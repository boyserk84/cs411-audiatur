(1, 'Airbourne', '                             <p>There&rsquos something about the kind of potent rock and roll fury that <strong>Airbourne</strong> cranks out, all cylinders firing, that makes you want to chug a beer straight down your throat and punch the air as though it&rsquod touched your wife inappropriately. It sounds crude, we admit. But that&rsquos the thing about these Aussie pub rock rebels. Their music, like new album <strong><em>No Guts. No Glory.</em>,</strong> are perfect soundtracks for drunken debauchery, and &ldquothat&rsquos what we&rsquore here for, mate,&rdquo says rowdy lead guitarist and vocalist <strong>Joel O&rsquoKeeffe</strong>.</p><br><p>Inspired by the likes of Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy, Angel City, Rose Tattoo, AC/DC and Motorhead, Airbourne have been waving the rock and roll flag for Australia since 2003, and in the process, winning fans and awards, like the one they took home in 2008 from the Metal Hammer Golden Gods, where the band&rsquos album <em>Runnin&rsquo Wild</em> was named the year&rsquos Best Debut Album. They hail from Warrnambool, a small drinking town on the southwestern coast of Victoria, Australia, and they&rsquove steadily gained an immense following among fans of infectious, high energy, whiskey-soaked, whiplash-inducing working man&rsquos rock. The band&rsquos new album is a mandatory addition to any self-respecting jukebox&rsquos library.</p><br><p>&ldquoBasically, we&rsquove never been about having a specific message we don&rsquot talk about politics or social injustices in our songs. There are other bands out there to take care of that,&rdquo says Joel O&lsquoKeeffe, who, like brother and Airbourne drummer <strong>Ryan O&rsquoKeeffe</strong>, has been playing guitar since he could walk. &ldquoWith us, it&rsquos not like that. It&rsquos just rock and roll. We want people to have a good time, no matter what. Have a drink, play it really loud, and kick back.&rdquo</p><br><p>Airbourne traveled to the Windy City to record <em>No Guts. No Glory.</em> with producer <strong>Johnny K</strong>, who has worked with Disturbed, Machine Head, Staind, and 3 Doors Down, among others. Like <em>Runnin&rsquo Wild</em>, <em>No Guts. No Glory.</em> continues that good time vibe, but ultimately, according to Ryan, the record is about &ldquostanding up and going for it, and being a man. There&rsquos a tougher element to the album, so to speak.&rdquo</p><br><p>Instead of sleeping every night in a comfortable hotel room bed on the label&rsquos dime, the band actually slept in the studio, taking inspiration from Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band, who were known to live in the studio until an album was completed.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe found out that they used to do that for the first bunch of records they did,&rdquo Joel explains, &ldquoso, the drums were set up in a big room with the guitars and [rhythm guitarist <strong>David Roads</strong>], he slept behind the amps I slept behind a bunch of amps Ryan slept behind his drum kit and [bassist <strong>Justin Street</strong>] slept behind this pool table, and we were all in the studio. It was really fun, because you&rsquod just get up and go, &lsquoFuck,&rsquo and start recording. That&rsquos how your day was. You just sort of woke up, had some food, and started recording. Maybe you&rsquod have a shower maybe not. Just sort of walk around in your shorts all day, just rocking away.&rdquo</p><br><p><em>No Guts. No Glory</em>., the band&rsquos second LP for <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>, was recorded live and straight to analog tape, and Airbourne essentially used the acoustics of the recording space as an impromptu instrument. &ldquoInstead of closing all the doors and keeping the sound all confined, we just left everything open, so the sound would bleed a bit more, so it sounds a bit more open than the last one,&rdquo Joel explained. &ldquoThat was one of the main differences. We just let it be open. We didn&rsquot care if the guitar solo bled through the bloody cymbal mikes. It&rsquos cool, because it adds to it.&rdquo</p><br><p>The album&rsquos a virtual rock and roll buffet, boasting tracks like &ldquoNo Way But The Hard Way&rdquo and &ldquoBlond, Bad and Beautiful.&rdquo&nbsp When the band lived together for three years on welfare in a Melbourne suburb, surviving on a steady diet of booze and barbecue, things were tough, and the band nearly burned their home to the ground- literally. &nbsp&ldquoNothing came easy, and we&rsquod say to each other, &lsquoAin&rsquot no way but the hard way,&rsquo&rdquo recalls Ryan.</p><br><p><em>No Guts. No Glory. </em>also features a song called &ldquoSteel Town,&rdquo which was inspired by the band&rsquos time on the road, and some of the people they had encountered. &ldquoEvery time we went through a town that was a steel town, there was something about the crowd themselves,&rdquo recalls Joel O&rsquoKeeffe. &ldquoThey seemed to be a little bit wilder, and they&rsquod always drink the pub dry, and we&rsquod have to get more beer from other pubs. There was always a massive fight, always a crazy crowd. So we wanted to give them a song that gives them a chance to raise their flag and pump their fists in the air, and drink a beer to it. I guess it&rsquos like throwing gasoline on the fire.&rdquo</p><br><p>Airbourne will be touring for much of 2010 in support of <em>No Guts. No Glory.</em> and for the O&rsquoKeeffe brothers, it&rsquos the band&rsquos live performance that brings folks coming back for more. &ldquoWe want to become that band that, people hear the name, and they know that they&rsquoll have a good time at the show,&rdquo Joel explains. &ldquoThey know what they&rsquore going to get. They&lsquore going to get rock and roll, and it&rsquos going to be loud, and they&rsquoll leave the concert with their ears ringing.&rdquo</p>', 2008, NULL),
(2, 'Baptized in Blood', '                             <p>&ldquoThere&rsquo;s an excitement here you can&rsquo;t get with other bands. We take what we do seriously nail you with modern thrash elements but still pull some fuckin&rsquo; weird shit out of our heads.&rdquo</p><br><p>Baptized In Blood guitarist Josh Torrance doesn&rsquo;t jest.</p><br><p>Influenced by everything from Gothenburg to glam&mdashas long as it&rsquo;s distorted&mdashthis London, Ontario-based five-piece runs the metallic gamut, creating a sound that is technically-inspired yet groove oriented and anthemnic in the same throw. Baptized In Blood are keepers of a sonic singularity that has established them as one of modern metal&rsquo;s most forthright, furious and frenetic heavy music bands to date, an aural prowess and thunderous dominance perfectly encapsulated on the band&rsquo;s sophomore effort/Roadrunner Records debut <em>Baptized In Blood</em>.</p><br><p>A collection of ravenously obliterating yet sonically masterful and provocative tunes,<em>Baptized In Blood </em>assures that while these men may only have just over a half-decade of experience under their belts, those countless hours of rehearsals, refinement and devastating performances (blood, sweat and tears) are never in vain. It prods one to wonder exactly how a band poised to realign the state of Great White metal forms in the first place.</p><br><p>&ldquoBoredom,&rdquo chuckles Fendley, noting how the absence of distraction&mdashnamely one particular sport circa 2004&mdashresulted in a unified commitment to decimate the barriers of metal. &ldquoIt was actually by chance. We were talking at the bar about how we should start a band since there was no hockey that year. Everybody piped up about the parts they wanted to do and it was done. We started writing songs and playing shows.&rdquo</p><br><p>Immediately packing venues thanks to both their unadulterated girth and various foundations in the local scene, Baptized In Blood quickly became a formidable endeavour. Issuing both an independent EP and full-length in expedient succession garnered the band an even stronger fan base, with the quintet&rsquo;s sincerity, hard work and endurance eventually commanding the attention of Roadrunner Records, a home where Baptized In Blood&rsquo;s diversity and devotion has resulted in their explosive eponymous affair.</p><br><p>To that extent, <em>Baptized In Blood</em> finds its namesake outfit striving to offer newfound grace, attitude and attack to metal via the aforementioned spirited enthusiasm and borderline-dichotomous influences. Heavily inspired by diverse aspects of thrash metal, punk and classic rock, <em>Baptized In Blood</em> offers a hard edge bolstered by both communicable melodies and outright pummeling amplitude.</p><br><p>&ldquoThere are the straight-up screamers who take it very seriously and have that tough guy, &rsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna try to kill you&rsquo; atmosphere in their music,&rdquo notes Torrance. &ldquoBut you have the opposite end of the spectrum where bands play the same type of stuff but have the extremely clean singing. We&rsquo;re right in the middle of that. Johl&rsquo;s screaming his ass off the entire time but you hear the melody. It&rsquo;s just as dirty either way though. As for the guitars, we&rsquo;re modern thrash but once again, a bit of glam inspiration infuses that excitement and flare.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoEither way, it&rsquo;s all about the metal,&rdquo Fendley interjects. &ldquoIf I had just raspy vocals the whole time, we&rsquo;d be slotted with thrash but if I was only guttural, we&rsquo;d be death metal. I move between all of that so we can&rsquo;t be pinned down. Baptized In Blood adapts to its surroundings because these songs are for us what we want to hear. We can&rsquo;t be lumped into specific sub-genres because we could write a power ballad and it would still be Baptized.&rdquo</p><br><p>Ensuring their vision was documented to perfection, Baptized In Blood enlisted the assistance of producer/engineer Zeuss (Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Chimaira) for the 15 songs that comprise their inaugural Roadrunner exhibition. Welcoming the band into his Hadley, Massachusetts-based Planet Z Studio, the legendary mastermind set about pulling out Baptized In Blood&rsquo;s inherently guttural crunch, overt vigor and virulence while still allowing their own modus to tear through to the bone.</p><br><p>&ldquoHe really worked us hard,&rdquo groans Torrance wryly while noting how<em> Baptized In Blood</em> benefits from broader dynamics, emotion and comprehensive grit thanks to the collaborative effort. &ldquoIt&rsquo;s more serious overall but it also has a fun vibe to it. It&rsquo;s one of those records that someone just getting into metal would think is awesome get out and party to. At the same time a veteran would do the exact same thing &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s uplifting.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoWe&rsquo;re a metal band working with a legendary hardcore producer,&rdquo adds Fendley enthusiastically. &ldquoThat gave us the inspiration to kick it up a notch. None of us were accepting second best.&rdquo</p><br><p>To that extent, both Fendley and Torrance relate that <em>Baptized In Blood </em>is easily the band&rsquo;s most cohesive work to date, propelled by motivation not only to excel but as Fendley notes, an acute history of personal affairs that drive the album to emotional extremes and in turn, engage the music to become harder, faster and inherently catchier.</p><br><p>&ldquoEverything I sing about, I&rsquo;ve gone through. I&rsquo;ve lived through this and write about what I know, not zombies, murder or anything like that. Everyday life motivates me. A lot of people go through what I have, so I try to keep a positive outlook on life because you alone have the choice of being pissed off or making the best of things. My message is that I&rsquo;ve been there too so maybe I can help you out. We&rsquo;re all in this together. As for this album, it&rsquo;s a step in a darker direction but still trying to keep my head above the clouds relieving stresses we as people are going through and asking questions. It&rsquo;s a battle cry: is anybody with me? Does anybody go through this crap too?&rdquo</p><br><p>Compelled by <em>Baptized In Blood</em>&rsquo;s rabid, ravenous and re-invigorating assault, Fendley&rsquo;s answer will come with resounding affirmation. Not only do we metallions relate to his lyrics but as this incensed, metal masterpiece unfolds, we are congenitally coerced into action. It&rsquo;s a state even Baptized In Blood themselves are unable to avoid.</p><br><p>&ldquoThis album is the result of a lot of hard work,&rdquo declares Fendley. &ldquoWe followed a dream and after six years we&rsquo;re at the starting point to really make this work. This album may be completed...but now it&rsquo;s time for us to really start busting ass.&rdquo</p>', 2010, NULL),
(3, 'Billy Talent ', '                             <p>Billy Talent singer Ben Kowalewicz has been front and centre in one of the greatest Canadian rock &lsquon&rsquo; roll success stories of the post-millennial era. The normally hyperactive front man is betraying neither cockiness nor complacency as he candidly assesses what might await the group in the summer of 2009.</p><br><p>Go back and listen to the chorus of &quot;Try Honesty, &quot;the monster single that broke Billy Talent and its eponymous debut album wide to the tune of triple-platinum sales in Canada back in 2003, and you&rsquo;ll remind yourself instantly that this band had the chops on delivery to stick around much longer than the mall-ready &quot;pop-punk&quot; fetish with which it was in some quarters initially, mistakenly associated. Instant chart success can be a bitch, though, and it was only after Billy Talent demonstrated its lasting mettle in the wake of 2006&rsquo;s Billy Talent II with three more platinum sales awards, a sold-out show at Toronto&rsquo;s 20,000-seat Air Canada Centre and, most unexpectedly, a No. 1 debut in Germany to match the one already notched at home that most reasonable folks from these parts finally woke up to the fact that they&rsquo;d been sleeping on a &quot;real deal&quot; in their midst.</p><br><p>Billy TalentBilly Talent is past all that, for the most part. Kowalewicz, guitarist Ian D&rsquo;Sa, bassist Jon Gallant and drummer Aaron Solowoniuk have been slogging away together for more than 15 years now and, consequently, have nothing to prove from a &quot;paying your dues&quot; standpoint. It would be nice nonetheless if the scorching Billy Talent III decisively hammered home to both the fans and the doubters what a shit-hot, world-dominating hard-rock band has grown out of these four former Mississauga teenagers&rsquo; shared high-school dreams of &hellip well &hellip growing into a shit-hot, world-dominating hard-rock band.</p><br><p>&quot;We got a rough shake at the beginning, and then, I think, people started really understanding our band,&quot; says D&rsquo;Sa. That was something that happened in the early years because, when a new band comes out, in the public&rsquo;s eyes, they need to be poked and prodded with &lsquoWhere&rsquo;s this band really coming from?&rsquo; I think people just got to understand us and now we don&rsquo;t have those problems that much anymore.&quot; Billy Talent is fairly oozing good songs on Billy Talent III, and for the first time they&rsquo;ve all made it to tape in pretty much the same form they&rsquo;d be heard during one of the breathless live shows that initially, decisively established and have since cemented the band&rsquo;s name and reputation.</p><br><p>Billy TalentFor this, some thanks are due &ndash if Billy Talent can be permitted a bit of uncharacteristic name-dropping &ndash to producer Brendan O&rsquo;Brien, who found time amidst a heroically busy schedule that recently added Bruce Springsteen and AC/DC to a list of superstar credits begun with Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Stone Temple Pilots to come north to Toronto and man the boards for the BTIII sessions.</p><br><p>The band never actually thought itself worthy of working with someone who&rsquo;d shaped the sound of so many of its members&rsquo; agreed-upon &quot;formative&quot; records. Nevertheless, when asked by attentive record-label folk to submit a list of &quot;dream&quot; producers for the new album, the boys gamely responded with one that placed O&rsquo;Brien at the top, then shared a good chuckle over their hopeless ambitions and simply proceeded under the assumption that D&rsquo;Sa would be picking up where he left off after quite capably co-producing the second Billy Talent LP alongside Gavin Brown.</p><br><p>&quot;He was our first choice but we didn&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;d ever want to work with a band like us,&quot; says a still slightly boggled D&rsquo;Sa, who traces the group&rsquo;s collective admiration for O&rsquo;Brien back to his work on two of the Rage Against the Machine records. &quot;They just sound phenomenal. They have these huge drum sounds, great guitar tones, the songs are all great &ndash he did an amazing job on those albums.&quot;</p><br><p>Billy Talent&quot;He engineered (the Red Hot Chili Peppers&rsquo;) Blood Sugar Sex Magik, too,&quot; adds Solowoniuk, &quot;which is going back to albums that shape you as musicians because that was one of them. That album blew me away. It blew all of us away.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;On the first day of preproduction in Toronto, just him showing up here, in this room, was definitely kind of intimidating,&quot; concedes D&rsquo;Sa. &quot;We set a chair aside for him and wrote &lsquoMr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo; on it. He didn&rsquo;t think it was funny.&quot;</p><br><p>As it turns out, O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s involvement only wound up further coaxing Billy Talent in the meatier, more deliberately paced and oh-so-slightly &quot;classicist&quot; riff-rock direction with which it was already flirting on the nascent tunes for Billy Talent III.</p><br><p>Lumbering, low-end-propelled behemoths such as &quot;Devil On My Shoulder,&quot; &quot;The Dead Can&rsquo;t Testify&quot; and &quot;Sudden Movements&quot; signal a marked departure from more customarily frenetic-but-melodic Billy Talent fare like &quot;Tears Into Wine&quot; and &quot;Turn Your Back&quot; (a pre-release teaser released to grateful radio audiences several months ago), unmistakably betraying a &lsquo70s AM-radio lineage shared with the early-&lsquo90s grunge that first compelled four future chart-toppers from suburban Toronto to take up their craft in earnest. Once Brendan O&rsquo;Brien was in the picture, it only made sense to keep going that way. He&rsquo;d helped cultivate their musical roots, after all if they were intuitively going back to them on their own, this had to represent the closing of some kind of circle.</p><br><p>Billy Talent</p><br><p>&quot;We never really planned out anything, but I&rsquo;d been coming up with a couple of riffs here and there that were a little more on the &rsquo;70s-rock side and some of those riffs ended up being songs like &lsquoDevil On My Shoulder,&rsquo;&quot; says D&rsquo;Sa. &quot;And we just wanted to keep going, just let things happen organically and see what happens. There was no real, grand design to it&hellip</p><br><p>&quot;At the time, we were all kind of listening to bands like Soundgarden and our favourite bands from the early &lsquo90s, all those grunge records. We kinda grew up in that generation, so I think that&rsquo;s where the influence kinda came from and it leaked into the music a little bit. You can hear it on the record. There&rsquo;s definitely a grunge-era influence on this record.&quot;</p><br><p>Kowalewicz concurs: &quot;Just being musicians, you have allegiances when you grow up. We grew up in the early &lsquo90s, when all these amazing bands came out &ndash Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Jane&rsquo;s Addiction. All these amazing things, we grew up with, and as time progressed we explored punk &ndash the Clash, the Pistols and things like that. We explored that avenue and, I guess, over time, as a progression, you kinda revert to a time when things made the most sense. And, I think, the early &lsquo90s kinda shaped us and our psyches and who we are and why we even play music.&quot;</p><br><p>Billy Talent</p><br><p>Regardless of how the tunes eventually shook down, tacit endorsement by an A-list production whiz of O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s stature &quot;probably lit a bit of that fire under us,&quot; as Gallant puts it, to step things up in the songwriting and musicianship departments heading into the studio. You can hear it in the playing, for sure, which has never sounded as dynamic and liquid and as definitively the product of 15 years&rsquo; worth of dogged, sweaty, night-by-night toil as it does on Billy Talent III &ndash check how limber the rhythm section rolls on the fond Police homage &quot;Diamond On A Landmine&quot; &ndash and was, at O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s urging, largely tracked for the first time while Billy Talent bashed it all out in the studio while playing together in the same room. And you can hear it in the broadened emotional range the band demonstrates in slower numbers like the wrenching &quot;White Sparrows,&quot; an almost-ballad that, Kowalewicz will allow, &quot;grew into something pretty magical&quot; by the time recording had wrapped. Maybe because &ndash shhhh &ndash someone finally figured out how to get this notorious shrieker to actually sing a verse or two once in a while.</p><br><p>&quot;People are always saying: &lsquoYou sound so different from record to live.&rsquo; And some people really like the way the records sound, some people really like the live stuff,&quot; says Kowalewicz. &quot;So one thing that, I think, we really wanted to do was amalgamate both, so that it sounds really big and heavy but there&rsquo;s still, like, this feeling that&rsquo;s really visceral and alive.&quot;</p><br><p>Mission accomplished. Billy Talent has never sounded more visceral, nor more alive than it does here. Nor more ready for the trans-continental rock-star close-up it&rsquo;s been threatening for a couple of records now. Heaven only knows we could use a few more hitmakers like these guys to remind us why we all cared about hits in the first place.</p>', 2009, NULL),
(4, 'Black Stone Cherry', '                             Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans, the new noise rang like a Sunday morning church bell, calling on saints and sinners alike to free their minds and become part of the revolution. They came out of the Southern swamps, the California desert, the working class towns of the Midwest and all along the East Coast.&nbsp Loud guitars and larger than life drumming came together with storytelling poetry.&nbsp Rebel-ism gave birth to rock &lsquon&rsquo roll.<br /><br />Every few years or so, a special batch comes up from the ground, to serve as a beacon.&nbsp <strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong> have arrived with their second Roadrunner Records release, <strong><em>Folklore and Superstition</em></strong>. &nbsp<br /><br />&quot;There is a mystique with folklore and superstition,&quot; says <strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong> drummer John Fred Young. &quot;We&rsquo;re intrigued by and interested in history, roots and heritage, and we incorporate that into our songs.&quot;<br /><br />The ability to tell compelling stories and lyrical tales isn&rsquo;t the only thing that <strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong> bring to the table. <strong><em>Folklore and Superstition</em></strong> isn&rsquo;t just a Southern rock record. It&rsquo;s an American rock n&rsquo roll record.&nbsp The album is a timeless work by American pied pipers destined to take their music from the back roads of America to the four corners of the globe.&nbsp &quot;We are taking Southern tradition and giving a taste to the rest of the world,&quot; says bassist/vocalist Jon Lawhon. <br /><br /><strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong> didn&rsquo;t stray too far away from home to record the album.&nbsp The band wrote all the songs in the infamous Practice House, an old farmhouse used by John Fred&rsquos father and uncle to write Grammy winning albums for The Kentucky Headhunters.&nbsp&nbsp A song like &ldquoSoul Creek&rdquo fills the room with its vintage arena rock sound yet was born where the band held bonfires around a creek across the country road. &nbsp<br /><br />The band enlisted famed rock producer Bob Marlette (Ozzy, Shinedown, Quiet Riot) and headed to Nashville&rsquos Blackbird Studios that has housed everyone from Kid Rock to The Raconteurs, just 85 miles from their hometown of Edmonton, Kentucky.&nbsp &ldquoWe incorporated regional sounds into the mix throughout the album,&rdquo says Young.&nbsp The band used turkey calls, a banjo and a washtub basin, among other things.&nbsp Jon Lawhon recalls, &quot;I made a washtub bass out of a broom handle and nylon rope!&quot;&nbsp Clearly, the band shied away from absolutely nothing when it came time to explore and experiment. &quot;We didn&rsquo;t want to leave any door unopened while recording,&quot; says guitarist/vocalist Ben Wells. <br /><br />Hitting the road in support of their 2006 self-titled debut helped inspire and direct <strong>Black Stone Cherry&rsquo;s</strong> worldview when it came time to write the new album. The band traveled extensively outside the United States during the tour cycle.&nbsp This allowed them to stretch their creative muscle with songs like &quot;Please Come In&quot; and &ldquoSunrise&rdquo which show the band&rsquo;s growth and diversity.<br /><br />&quot;This album has allowed us to dig deep into our roots,&quot; continues Young. &quot;It also shows our influences in the songwriting. Our band is a positive band and we try to write songs that are uplifting. We also have a big storytelling side to us which comes through on songs like &rsquo;Ghost of Floyd Collins&rsquo and &lsquoReverend Wrinkle.&rsquo&quot;<br /><br />Vocalist/guitarist Chris Robertson reflects on the process, saying, &ldquoStarting out as a band seven years ago, with high hopes and even bigger dreams, I honestly believe this record shows the experience of our past travels, and gives a hint of the future. It captures all the energy and heart that embody <strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong>. We took some chances on this album and I believe that our fans will appreciate seeing the other sides of the band that they may or may not have known existed.&rdquo<br /><br />Ben Wells comments on the band&rsquos expansion of its sound and subject matter, saying &quot;The songwriting took on a life of its own, as the structures of the songs themselves have grown so much from touring. We have so much more to talk about and can apply the things we picked up musically.&rdquo He admits the band also kept the ladies in mind this time around, recalling, &ldquoOn the last album, girls would come up to us and say, &rsquo;You have songs for guys, so where are our songs?&rsquo&nbsp So we have a song called &rsquo;You&rsquo; on this album, which is a timeless ballad.&quot;<br /><br />The band&rsquos family and friends are another influence. &quot;Long Sleeves&quot; is told from the viewpoint of a friend who took part in the battle of Mogadishu as featured in the film &ldquoBlack Hawk Down,&rdquo while &quot;Things My Father Said&quot; is a ballad that hits home with people from all walks of life.&nbsp &nbsp<br /><br />From the eerie swagger of &ldquoThe Key&rdquo to the tell tale rocker &ldquoBlind Man&rdquo to the triumphant stomp of the anthem &ldquoSoulcreek,&rdquo to the heartfelt message of &ldquoPeace Is Free,&rdquo Black Stone Cherry say the trick to Folklore and Superstition is simply brotherhood, family, friends and home no more, no less. <br /><br />For further information, please contact Jessica Ricci or Amy Sciarretto at Roadrunner Records:&nbsp 212.274.7500, ricci@roardrunnerrecords.com, amy@roadrunnerrecords.com.<br /><br /><br />', 2006, NULL),
(5, 'Bleeker Ridge', '                             <p>Orillia, Ontario&rsquos Bleeker Ridge had a good seven years of dedicated rehearsals, songwriting and gigs before landing a dream record deal with Roadrunner Records Canada and cutting an album, <em>Small Town Dead</em>, with legendary producer Bob Marlette (Shinedown, Default, Seether, Airbourne), chockfull of hooky hard rock anthems. That kind of woodshedding might not seem unusual, except the band formed when they were kids.</p><br><p>The melodic hard rock quartet is comprised of two sets of brothers &mdash lead singer Taylor Perkins 21 guitarist Cole Perkins, 19 guitarist Dan Steinke, 19 and drummer Dustin Steinke, 20 &mdash who met in 2003 at a local jam night in Lagoon City (pop. 3000).&nbsp They went from playing Joe Walsh and Jimi Hendrix covers to writing originals, which they released on two independent CDs.</p><br><p>But the songs on their label debut, <em>Small Town Dead</em>, recorded at Henson Studios in Hollywood and Bob&rsquos home studio in Woodland Hills, California, shows a band whose musicianship and songwriting skills belie their years. Radio and arena ready, they include the riffy soulful title-track confrontational opener &ldquoEasier Today&rdquo heavier groove, &ldquoSixteen Hours&rdquo searing power ballad, &ldquoIn Our Hands&rdquo and sentimental stunner, &ldquoYou Would&rsquove Liked It.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoWe&rsquove always been more into songwriting than anything else, even when we were 13,&rdquo says Taylor. &ldquoWhen we&rsquore writing songs, we&rsquore always looking to say, &lsquoThat&rsquos cool,&rsquo and making the songs huge. We&rsquore all about trying to come up with rock &lsquon&rsquo roll songs that can still be melodic and heavy and touch people with the lyrics.&rdquo</p><br><p>All 12 songs on <em>Small Town Dead</em> were penned by Bleeker Ridge, including four co-writes that started with the band, &ldquoIn Our Hands&rdquo &ldquoPick Me Up&rdquo and gentler &ldquoStill Standing&rdquo with Dave Bassett (Shinedown, Sevendust) and southern-styled kicker, &ldquoSick of You,&rdquo with Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman.&nbsp</p><br><p>&ldquoThree years ago, we decided to write a song that we think we can hear on the radio,&rdquo recalls Dan.&nbsp &ldquoThat song, &lsquoIn Our Hands,&rsquo took a shape that we&rsquod never thought about doing before. We sent it to Dave and he was like, &lsquoHoly shit.&rsquo We had like 16 different versions, but that was the song that changed the whole perspective of writing for us.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoSmall Town Dead,&rdquo is the album&rsquos first single and is a particularly personal lyric for Bleeker Ridge that resonates for anyone who grew up outside a big city. &ldquoFrom talking with friends and kids I meet, I find that being in a small town like mine, everyone has the same outlook &mdash there&rsquos never anything to do,&rdquo Taylor explains. &ldquoYou can go watch a movie, then go break things [laughs].&rdquo</p><br><p>There&rsquos also a song for all those kids who have finally left school behind and aren&rsquot looking forward to growing up and getting out in the real world. &ldquo<em>Trust the words I am speaking / Don&rsquot let it bring you down / &lsquocause now we&rsquore falling forward / Everyone tells me that the party&rsquos over</em>,&rdquo Taylor sings in the inspirational anthem &ldquoFrom Now On.&rdquo</p><br><p>He also wrote some beautiful words in &ldquoYou Would Have Liked It,&rdquo lamenting the loss of a girlfriend, wife or loved one who is unable to share in life&rsquos defining moments, a theme quite advanced for a 21-year-old that can definitely tug at people twice his age.</p><br><p>With these new songwriting skills &mdash something many people in the music industry were waiting for them to develop before they were willing to commit to the band &mdash Bob Marlette was excited to work with them. He had first seen Bleeker Ridge six years ago at a showcase in Toronto, but felt they needed to mature. Later, by sheer coincidence, he was producing a band whose management mentioned the new act on its roster &mdash Bleeker Ridge. He couldn&rsquot believe it.</p><br><p>&ldquoBob&rsquos a legend,&rdquo says Dan. &ldquoEverything I&rsquove ever grown up listening to this guy&rsquos had a part in doing. Just being around him makes you want to be a better musician.&rdquo</p><br><p>Now Bleeker Ridge is itching to get out on the road, the obvious next step for four guys who made the most of small town dead and curbed the boredom by playing in a rock band. &ldquoIt&rsquos been five or six years of writing songs and it&rsquos all been leading up to this moment of getting on the bus and just going for it,&rdquo says Dan. &ldquoThat&rsquos what we live for &ndash playing shows.&rdquo</p>', 2010, NULL),
(6, 'Cavalera Conspiracy', '                             &quot;The<strong> Cavalera Conspiracy </strong>is about a<br>sense of being unleashed,&quot; says vocalist/guitarist <strong>Max Cavalera</strong>. &quot;You<br>bottle a monster for 10 years and then let it out.&nbsp It&rsquo;s explosive, and we waited a long time for this beast to be<br>set free.&quot;<br /><br /> It&rsquo;s true. The wait is over. And the time is now. Many said it would <em>never </em>happen,<br>that Max and <strong>Iggor Cavalera</strong>, the Brazilian brothers and visionaries that<br>formed the groundbreaking metal band Sepultura in 1983 would reunite to make<br>electrifying music together again. Despite having spent 12 years apart, the<br>inescapable fact remains: Max and Iggor share blood and are musical soulmates.<br>Their time away from each other fostered musical growth leading to the newly<br>inspired metallic magic. Hence, the Cavalera Conspiracy was born. While the<br>Cavalera Conspiracy and their <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong> debut <strong><em>Inflikted</em></strong><em> </em>may seem like the closest we&rsquo;ll get to a Sepultura reunion, make no<br>mistake. The Cavalera Conspiracy is its own maniacal, untamable beast with its<br>own set of rules.<br /><br /> Iggor sums up their musical connection,<br>simply stating, &quot;We don&rsquo;t need to speak. We look at each other and we <em>know</em>.<br>With one look, we know if we&rsquo;re going in the right direction.&quot; That&rsquo;s how<br>clearly they understand one another.<br /><br /> Max continues, &quot;There was over 10 years of<br>not seeing or talking to each other at all, which is a long ass time. That&rsquo;s<br>what made it more special when it did finally happen. While we were working<br>together, I was thinking about how the last time I saw him, I was on a tour<br>bus, after my last show with Sepultura at the Brixton Academy. Fast forward and<br>I&rsquo;m picking him up at the airport in Phoenix. It was heavy and emotional.<br>Obviously, all those feelings, along with years of musical history, came<br>flooding back, and once the personal relationship was restored, the musical one<br>began to take shape. <br /><br /> The first seeds of the Max/Iggor reunion<br>were planted when the duo played together at the Dana Tribute show, an annual<br>benefit played for Max&rsquo;s slain stepson. &quot;I was playing with Iggor at a show<br>that was so meaningful,&quot; Max admits. &quot;We got to play &lsquoRoots&rsquo; and &lsquoAttitude,&rsquo;<br>which is a song I wrote with Dana.&nbsp From<br>that point on, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. I knew I wanted to record with him<br>again. I had not done a &lsquoproject&rsquo; since Nailbomb, which was a long time ago.<br>Iggor loved the idea. With no name, I just wrote songs all day long. We had to<br>find musicians, and set the mood so we could just write a kick ass record.&quot;<br>Iggor has similar fond memories of that show and that feeling, &quot;Once we hit the<br>first note, it felt like a bomb had dropped on stage. From that moment on, I<br>knew we needed to do something together musically.&quot;<br /><br /> Iggor continues,<br>&quot;We reunited as a family first. Naturally, music came next. At first, we had no<br>idea we would do music again. I have my own new project, and that takes so much<br>of my time. I had no plans at all of going back and doing a metal project. But<br>at the same time, it was natural to play again with Max.&quot; Max compares the<br>situation to <em>The Godfather Part III, </em>exclaiming, &quot;Just when Al Pacino<br>thought he was out, his family pulled him right back into the shit again!<br>That&rsquo;s what I did: I pulled him right back.&quot;<br /><br /> The brothers<br>recruited Gojira guitarist <strong>Joe Duplantier</strong> to play bass.&nbsp Guitarist <strong>Marc Rizzo</strong>, who plays<br>guitar in Max&rsquo;s main band Soulfly, was enlisted to play guitar. The duo<br>purposely chose more up and coming musicians, because they didn&rsquo;t want to<br>detract from the music. &quot;We didn&rsquo;t want big names,&quot; Max says. &quot;It was about me<br>and Iggor finding ourselves. This is about the music. We found cool musicians<br>without pretension, who wanted to go into the studio and just kick ass.&quot;<br /><br /> Once recording commenced, Max brought a<br>bunch of songs he had written. Album opener &quot;Inflikted&quot; is an urgent, thrashy<br>anthem designed for the most riotous moshpits, while &quot;Sanctuary&quot; has a classic <em>Beneath<br>The Remains-</em>era Sepultura vibe. Max says, &quot;I brought the tracks to the<br>studio without the fury. Iggor put his &lsquothunder drums&rsquo; on top of it and it<br>became something else!&quot; Although Iggor exited Sepultura and is working on his<br>electronic music project, that familiar feeling coursed through his veins when<br>he sat down to track drums. &quot;We had no pressure on our backs. The most<br>important thing is that we were happy in the studio we worked a lot and it was<br>a blast. That translates into the music,&quot; Iggor says.<br /><br /> When describing the sonic assault that is &quot;Black Ark,&quot; Max states,<br>&quot;I think &quot;Black Ark&quot;&nbspis the most different song on<em> Inflikted</em>.&nbsp<br>My son Richie, was the first vocalist to sing on it and he set the pace for a<br>different vocal pattern that Joe and I picked up on.&nbsp It made the track<br>more unique than the other songs.&quot;<br /><br /> About half way into the album, the brothers<br>Cavalera hit you over the head with the brutal &quot;Ultra-Violent&quot; which features <strong>Rex<br>Brown</strong> of Down and Pantera on bass.&nbsp<br>&quot;I think I gave him a very exciting, different song to work on, more of<br>a death metal vibe.&nbsp We had a great time talking about our old metal<br>adventures,&quot; says Max.<br /><br /> By the time the record was finished, Max<br>knew that they had recaptured the magic. &quot;My brother makes the drums sound like<br>thunder like no one else. Not many musicians can grab a kit and change the sound<br>and personality of the drums, but he can.&nbsp<br>It&rsquo;s fucking scary.&quot; While the Soulfly and Sepultura comparisons will<br>undoubtedly - natch - arise, both brothers contend that the Cavalera Conspiracy<br>is different because their tastes and influences have grown over the years.<br>There&rsquo;s less of a world vibe on<em> Inflikted,</em> but its every bit as<br>dangerous, thanks to its &quot;fuck the world&quot; attitude.&nbsp &quot;Why do I get goosebumps when listening to this? I don&rsquo;t want to<br>know,&quot; says Max. <br /><br /> According to Iggor, <em>Inflikted&rsquo;s</em> balance of the old and the new is what he loves about it and he thinks<br>metalheads across the globe will share the same notion. &quot;When I listen to the<br>album, it sounds old school, but new in its own way,&quot; he says. &quot;It&rsquo;s a mix of<br>both worlds. We both listened to so much different music during the time apart.<br>Here, we each had our own input, so it came out different than back in the<br>day.&quot;<br /><br /> Summing up their personal chemistry, which<br>is palpable on the booming &quot;Bloodbrawl&quot; and the uber thrash attack &quot;Terrorize,&quot;<br>Max says, &quot;I&rsquo;m crazy. I used to drink. I talk. He is quiet. He has never drank<br>before. It&rsquo;s this weird combo that becomes lethal together. You either like it<br>or hate it, but you can&rsquo;t ignore it. We&rsquo;re like a bomb.&quot;<br /><br />', 2008, NULL),

It&rsquos quite simple:&nbsp the love of the music. While it would have been easy for the members of Collective Soul &ndash <strong>Ed Roland</strong>, <strong>Dean Roland</strong>, <strong>Will Turpin</strong> and <strong>Joel Kosche</strong> - to rest on their laurels, the excitement they feel for their forthcoming (and 2<sup>nd</sup> self-titled) release is palpable. &ldquoEverybody just really took a big step, dug in, and worked together as a band. It was really nice,&rdquo says Ed Roland &ldquoIt made everything smoother and that&rsquos why I think it&rsquos the best work we&rsquove done in years.&rdquo After years of touring together, with hit after successive hit, Collective Soul is as focused as ever.</p><br><p>&nbsp2009 finds the band releasing their 8<sup>th</sup> studio album on a new label, Loud &amp Proud/Roadrunner Records. The album opens with &ldquoWelcome All Again,&rdquo a rousing number about life in the studio (Roland&rsquos lake house), and is a sure bet to be the concert opener on the new tour. &ldquoThe lake house was extremely important to us,&rdquo says Ed, &ldquoIt enclosed us so we had to get up in the morning and work all day. It&rsquos a home, so it gave us freedom with time and schedules. &nbspEveryone can wake up, have their coffee, do their morning routine &hellipthen when the vibe starts you let it go until the vibe ends. &nbspI truly believe the lake house helped bring Collective Soul together, better than ever. &rdquo</p><br><p>&nbspWith first single &ldquoStaring Down,&rdquo Collective Soul is convincing us that the world doesn&rsquot have to be a dark place after a bad relationship, &ldquoYou get out of a relationship and you realize you can let go of that energy if you leave yourself open to positive energy, you find it&rsquos right there in front of you. Just let it find you.&rdquo Says Roland. Other hot tracks include the driving &ldquoDig,&rdquo the sobering, yet funky riffed &ldquoMy Days,&rdquo&nbsp &ldquoYou,&rdquo the first song Collective Soul has ever written as a unit, and &ldquoFuzzy,&rdquo with the whole band harmonizing together as good as any Beach Boys single.</p><br><p>&nbspThe record ends with a quiet, spiritual reflection in &ldquoHymn For My Father:&rdquo &ldquoIt&rsquo;s fitting,&rdquo says Ed, &ldquoI grew up singing hymns and with my father&rsquo;s passing 4 years ago it&rsquo;s truly a tribute to him. He taught me the music I grew up listening too which he loved and I really wanted to write a fitting tribute.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbspHailing from the city of Atlanta, Georgia, Collective Soul shot to international fame with their 1993 release <em>Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid</em>, and their mega #1 hit &ldquoShine.&rdquo The album was a collection of Ed Roland&rsquos demos that spread quickly through the college underground circuit and caught fire, going on to achieve Double-Platinum status. After having been invited to the 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Woodstock concert, Collective Soul went into the studio to record their sophomore follow up. The self-titled <em>Collective Soul</em>, released in March of 1995, would be the album that would help define their sound of catchy melodies and guitar driven songs. Containing four outstanding singles (three of which reached #1), &ldquoDecember,&rdquo &ldquoThe World I Know,&rdquo &ldquoWhere The River Flows,&rdquo and &ldquoGel,&rdquo it became Collective Soul&rsquo;s highest selling album to date. The album went Triple-Platinum and spent 76 weeks on the Billboard Top 200 charts.</p><br><p>&nbspCollective Soul went back into the studio and vented their spleen on 1997&rsquos Platinum <em>Disciplined Breakdown</em>, which produced two more #1 hits, &ldquoPrecious Declaration&rdquo and &ldquoListen<strong>.&rdquo </strong>1999 brought the album <em>Dosage</em>, a critically acclaimed set of songs that fans count as the band&rsquos best. The album took a meticulous six months to record, and provided another strong showing for the band, producing the #1 hit song &ldquoHeavy,&rdquo which would take the top <em>Billboard </em>spot for a (then) record of 15 weeks.&nbsp Of the band&rsquos 5<sup>th</sup> studio album, <em>Rolling Stone</em> cheered, &ldquo<em>Blender</em> simply shreds with unapologetic classic-rock energy.&rdquo Once again, the band teamed with Resta, and created three more radio heavy smash hits with &ldquoWhy, Part 2,&rdquo &ldquoVent&rdquo and &ldquoPerfect Day,&rdquo a duet with Sir Elton John.<strong></strong></p><br><p>&nbspAfter releasing a Greatest Hits set entitled <em>7even Year Itch: Greatest Hits 1994-2001</em>, Collective Soul ended their contract with Atlantic Records and created their own label El Music Group. The first release on the label was <em>Youth</em> (2004). The lyrics, in particular &ldquoBetter Now,&rdquo declared the band&rsquo;s newfound confidence and independence. Two other records and a concert DVD were released under the El Music Group imprint: 2005&rsquos EP <em>From the Ground Up</em> and 2006&rsquos <em>Home </em>- their lush, live, concert event with the Atlanta City Youth Orchestra.</p><br><p>&nbspIn 2007 the band made an exclusive deal with all Target stores to be the sole seller of their 7<sup>th</sup> Studio album, <em>Afterwords. </em>The fans dug it, opening at #25 on the <em>Billboard </em>Comprehensive Albums Chart and #5 on the <em>Billboard</em> Top Internet Albums Chart, proving Collective Soul was now conquering the digital world.</p><br><p>&nbsp&quot;Tremble For My Beloved&quot; found Collective Soul on the soundtrack to one of the hottest movies of 2008 &ndash <em>Twilight</em>. &ldquoWe heard through the grapevine that Stephanie Meyer was a fan of Collective Soul&rsquo;s music and lyrics,&rdquo says Ed.

(8, 'DevilDriver', '                             <p><strong>DevilDriver </strong>has always been a band on a three-pronged mission: Work hard, rock harder, and kick as many asses as possible in the process.</p><br><p>Since first forming in 2003, the Santa Barbara metal quintet has stuck resolutely to this mission, even though it&rsquo;s often meant traveling a rougher, less glamorous road than most musicians would prefer to endure. Rather than cashing in on the popularity of his previous successes, frontman <strong>Dez Fafara</strong> insisted from the get-go that DevilDriver should not only forge their own unique sound, but should also start at the proverbial bottom of the bill and work their way up through endless touring, earning the music world&rsquo;s respect one fan at a time.</p><br><p>&quot;I get that hard-working attitude from my father,&quot; says Dez. &quot;I believe in gnawing at the bit, you know? It&rsquo;s taken its toll on us, sure - but hard work, road work and belief in ourselves is what we&rsquo;re based on.&quot;</p><br><p><strong><em>Pray For Villains</em></strong>, DevilDriver&rsquo;s gut-punching new album, is clearly the culmination of that endless hard work and unconquerable self-belief. Having honed their powerful sound over the course of three previous albums - 2003&rsquo;s self-titled debut, 2005&rsquo;s <em>The Fury of Our Maker&rsquo;s Hand</em> and 2007&rsquo;s <em>The Last Kind Words</em> -&nbspand countless live dates (including their legendary Download appearance in 2007, where the band&rsquo;s ferocious performance triggered what many believe to be the largest circle pit in history), the band is now operating at a higher level than ever before.</p><br><p>&quot;For us, it&rsquo;s been a constant growth, musically,&quot; Dez explains. &quot;Not only in terms of finding out how to write together, but in figuring out what a good DevilDriver song <em>is</em>. Every single record has been a progression, and we approached everything the same way as we&rsquo;ve always done, but it clicked really hard on this record. This is the defining sound of what we are, and where we&rsquo;re going to go in the future.&quot;</p><br><p>Produced by former Machine Head/Soulfly guitarist Logan Mader (who has previously manned the controls for the Cavalera Conspiracy, Divine Heresy and Five Finger Death Punch), <em>Pray For Villains</em> finds DevilDriver rocking as brutally as ever, with the rhythm section of drummer John Boecklin and bassist Jon Miller pummeling the listener into submission while the guitar tag-team of Jeff Kendrick and Mike Spreitzer lets fly with one nasty riff and incendiary solo after another, and Dez truly howls like a man possessed. The album is both more technical and more straightforward than anything DevilDriver has done in the past, but there&rsquo;s also an additional emphasis on groove, dynamics and song-craft.</p><br><p>&quot;We decided not to go even more brutal, more heavy, more screamy, more fast than last time, because we&rsquo;ve already proved we can do that,&quot; says Dez. &quot;There&rsquo;s a lot more groove going on, a lot more dynamics. The guitar work is amazing -some of the solos absolutely blow me away - and the drumming is un-fucking-real. There&rsquo;s gonna be kids in their basements trying to learn this shit forever. Yet we also said, &lsquoLet&rsquo;s not only bring groove into this, but let&rsquo;s bring hooks, and let&rsquo;s write <em>better</em> songs.&rsquo; We didn&rsquo;t dial it down at all, but we wanted to add some substance to it, as well.&quot;</p><br><p>Lyrically and thematically, the album&rsquo;s rampaging title track pretty much sums up where Dez is coming from on <em>Pray For Villains</em>.&nbsp Inspired by his love of Western films, the song is about &quot;how you put all your eggs in one basket, and you bet on the hero - but it&rsquo;s actually the bad-ass villain who comes in and saves the day,&quot; he explains. &quot;I love Westerns, especially the ones with Clint Eastwood I like the anti-heroes, rather than the John Wayne kind of guys. I was thinking that in those films, just like in real life, it usually takes a fucking bad-ass to come in and do the job - and that&rsquo;s usually not the guy in white with the shiny gun. A lot of these songs, including &lsquoResurrection Blvd.,&rsquo; &lsquoIn The Cards&rsquo; and &lsquoForgiveness Is A Six-Gun,&rsquo; are definitely influenced by that.&quot;</p><br><p>Themes of self-reliance, hard work and positive energy also run through tracks like &quot;I See Belief,&quot; &quot;Pure Sincerity&quot; and &quot;Back With A Vengeance,&quot; all of which reflect both the scars and the hard-won accomplishments of DevilDriver&rsquo;s first half-decade. &quot;I&rsquo;m not a nihilistic dude,&quot; Dez explains. &quot;The line,&lsquoI see belief when no one else does&rsquo; - a lot of people are so negative about things, saying, &lsquoOh, that will never work,&rsquo; or &rsquo;We&rsquo;ll never get that tour,&rsquo; or &lsquoWe&rsquo;ll never get to that place&rsquo; but I&rsquo;m just not that guy. Call it stupidity or blind luck,&quot; he laughs, &quot;but I&rsquo;ve got a feel for what&rsquo;s going to happen with this band. I believe in the motivation and upward mobility of this band, as well as the movement and the bond that we&rsquo;re creating between our fans and us. I want to bring that positivity through the power of metal and say to people, &lsquoHey, keep your head up/Get your head out of the sand&rsquo;- take a breath of fresh air, try to be positive about life, and move through it with strength, power and belief in yourself.&quot;</p><br><p>Of &quot;Pure Sincerity,&quot; Dez reveals, &quot;That&rsquo;s for when people ask, &lsquoWhat&rsquo;s DevilDriver about?&rsquo; Well, listen to &lsquoPure Sincerity&rsquo;: &lsquoGive &lsquoem what they want/Give &lsquoem what they need/Pure Sincerity&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s ever been, from the time we started making music - giving them what we feel is <em>our</em> music, and not trying to follow any kind of trend.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;Back With a Vengeance&quot; is a howl of triumph, a musical victory lap for a band that many critics discounted or disregarded, at least until DevilDriver&rsquo;s ever-increasing fanbase and reputation for consistently punishing live shows became simply too much to ignore. &quot;That song&rsquo;s about looking yourself in the mirror and going, &lsquoYep, that&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re kicking ass like I always knew we would be,&rsquo;&quot; Dez explains. &quot;Don&rsquo;t ever count any motherfucker out in life. It may have taken a record or three to get it through everybody&rsquo;s heads, but now it&rsquo;s obvious. And on &lsquoBack With A Vengeance,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m actually giving myself a minute to step back and look at DevilDriver and go, &lsquoHoly shit, we all built this thing together - and it&rsquo;s a monstrous machine!&rsquo;&quot;</p><br><p>To no one&rsquo;s surprise, DevilDriver will be taking that monstrous machine on the road for the rest of 2009, and probably beyond. (The band&rsquo;s innate affinity for touring is reflected on the new tracks &quot;I&rsquo;ve Been Sober&quot; and &quot;Another Night In London.&quot;) &quot;We need to travel,&quot; says Dez. &quot;So we&rsquo;re booked through Christmas &lsquo09 we&rsquo;re going all over the world, and we&rsquo;re not coming home. Our schedule is so rigorous, it&rsquo;s unreal - sometimes even I don&rsquo;t know why I put myself through it - but I love the road. I love my family, but I can&rsquo;t sit home for more than two weeks,&quot; he laughs. &quot;I think time for me at home is wasted right now. I&rsquo;m still young enough to go out and do my thing.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;You have to love what you do,&quot; Dez concludes. &quot;We love to play together as a band, we love to be onstage, and we love to deliver our music to people live. We&rsquo;ve always said that&rsquo;s been part of the mission - and if you&rsquo;re gonna talk it, you&rsquo;ve gotta walk it.&quot;&lt--&gt</p>', 2003, NULL),

The single &quot;Through the Fire and Flames&quot; has been RIAA-certified Gold and 2006&rsquo;s Inhuman Rampage, which debuted at #1 on Billboard&rsquo;s Heatseeker&rsquo;s Chart, has sold over 300,000 copies in its wake.<br /><br />Over those two fateful years following the album&rsquo;s release, the band toured America for the first time in their career and were embraced with open arms. The first tour was sold out before Inhuman Rampage even hit record store shelves and the marathon cycle continued for well over a year, as they dominated the main stage of 2006&rsquo;s Ozzfest, followed that up with a sold-out headline run and a plum support slot opening for new labelmates, Killswitch Engage, before heading home to work on Ultra Beatdown, an excellent effort that rivals its predecessor in every facet. <br /><br />Ultra Beatdown is bigger, louder and faster, teeming with guitar solos that are sure to wear the fingerprints off the hands of Herman Li and Sam Totman, the band&rsquo;s virtuoso tandem of shredders. Vocalist ZP Theart gives the performance of his career, reaching for the stars with his soaring, powerful voice, while bassist Frederic Leclercq and drummer Dave Mackintosh provide the sturdy rhythmic backbone for the album. Keytarist Vadim Pruzhanov layers the band&rsquo;s sound with a healthy dose of keys and the end result is an album that thrills with glorious guitars, siren-like vocals and memorable melodic flair. If DragonForce arrived on American shores with Inhuman Rampage, they are poised to conquer with Ultra Beatdown, set for release on August 26.<br /><br />DragonForce are much more than a band they&rsquo;re almost like a cult that has commanded a legion of diehard fans that range from guitar nerds, video game aficionados and young, impressionable kids who are just discovering music as they attempt to jam out to Dragonforce while playing Guitar Hero. <br /><br />&quot;We are not deluded, thinking we are rock stars or cool or taking over the world or are the future of metal,&quot; says Li, with his trademark dry-and possibly humble-British wit. &quot;We approached this album the same way we always have. We treat it like we haven&rsquo;t got any fans, since we are trying to make music we want to hear ourselves. We have been listening to metal for so long that we are sick and tired of hearing the same thing all the time. We want to make the catchiest album ever and we want to do something that you can&rsquo;t hear from other bands that play the same style that we do.&quot; Clearly, DragonForce are their own biggest critics they set the bar high for themselves as musicians. Li continues, &quot;We&rsquo;re not going to change our music for the world, but we&rsquo;re going to improve so we can take what we do and make it better.&quot;<br /><br />That type of passion for music is what drives DragonForce in the middle of all the Guitar Hero hype. The band remains grounded and is staying the course, infusing Ultra Beatdown with the same bombastic guitarwork and battlecry lyrics. Li is adamant that the band isn&rsquo;t going to cater to anyone but themselves and their truest fans, saying,&nbsp &quot;People were already listening to us before anyone found Inhuman Rampage. Our first US tour sold out before the album came out. People liked us before Guitar Hero. Our goal is to take all the experience we&rsquo;ve accumulated and make our live show ever better.&quot;<br /><br />The self-produced Ultra Beatdown keeps the patented DragonForce pace and burns itself into the fabric of your brain with its massive melodies and air-guitarable solos. Li sheds a little light on the songwriting process, saying &quot;When you write a song, you never know how it is going to turn out. We approach it so that we have to do the best song possible without overlooking the production, since we produce it ourselves.&nbsp We don&rsquo;t want three-minute songs you can swallow and enjoy. We like fast, seven minute songs where there is so much stuff happening. The idea is not to compromise. We can&rsquo;t deliver our message in the space of three minutes and we&rsquo;re not looking to write hits. All we want to do is write what is a great piece of music, a combination of metal and rock.&quot; <br /><br />DragonForce aren&rsquo;t masking their motives, and they back up their confidence with both skill and talent that separates them from anyone who can be considered their peers. Li says, &quot;The speed is so obvious, so that is the first thing.&nbsp So many bands play fast, even faster than us, but it&rsquo;s not melodic. Ultra Beatdown has the whole package of melody, arrangement and catchiness with the speed.&quot; The band also claims video game music as an influence, simply because it&rsquo;s melodic and memorable.<br /><br />Due to this patented style, Ultra Beatdown pulses with anthemic, feel good, battle-ready and uplifting songs. Li laughs when pointing out &quot;the funny thing is that we just want to create a catchy, memorable tune and when we do that, even the sadder songs sound happy! Our songs are tuneful but they also touch your heart.&quot;&nbsp Indeed, &quot;Heroes of Our Time,&quot; the album&rsquo;s first single, is catchy and room filling, while &quot;Last Journey Home&quot; shows a different, slower side of the band, illustrating their range and musicianship, which is something each member takes very seriously.<br /><br />While the band is known for fun live shows that often saw them jumping on trampolines and mimicking each other while performing, they are as serious as a terminal disease about their craft. &quot;Our personalities are so different,&quot; Li explains. &quot;But we got together to make an album and the whole thing comes together and is special. We have a serious side in making music, but when we are tour and people see and hear us enjoying ourselves. We&rsquo;re serious about our playing and we&rsquo;re happy with being cool and nerdy.&quot;<br /><br />Another element that makes DragonForce so special is the fact that each member hails from a different country and background. Li is from Hong Kong, while Theart was born in South Africa. Totman is a New Zealander, while Leclerqc is French, Prushanov is Romanian and Mackintosh is British. This eclectic mix and disparate upbringings contribute to the melting pot that is the band.&nbsp &quot;Many bands come from same town, same school and are very similar,&quot; Li says. &quot;With us, absolutely not. Despite the different cultures and backgrounds,&nbsp we have a common goal in the end and that is to make a great album and enjoy ourselves at the same time in life, by doing music. It&rsquo;s down to that.&quot;<br /><br />At the end of the day, according to Li, DragonForce is &quot;a non-stop melody fest. It&rsquo;s never just riffs. If there is a riff, there is a melody on top.&quot; They&rsquo;ve incorporated the influence of guitar titans like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as well as video games, thus creating a style uniquely their own that is appealing to music nerds, the general public or anyone who likes intensity in their music.<br /><br />Li finishes, summing up the band&rsquo;s recent trajectory, saying, &quot;Ultra Beatdown follows the path of our last two albums. Sonic Firestorm implies that the sound is going to blow you away, whereas Inhuman Rampage indicates that we&rsquo;re going to musically kick your ass. Ultra Beatdown is where the music is kicking your ass and giving you the biggest beatdown possible. The music is going to kick your ass.&quot; Armed with a boatload of melody and intensity, this is one Beatdown you will more than enjoy. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />', 2006, NULL),

group first came together in 1985, when Petrucci, Portnoy and bassist John Myung were students at Boston&rsquos Berklee School of Music.&nbsp Initially known as Majesty, the nascent combo quickly gained a reputation in the grassroots metal underground, with their cassette <em>The Majesty Demos</em> becoming a sought-after item in the metal community.</p><br><p>Dream Theater made a mainstream splash with their 1992 sophomore album <em>Images And Words</em>, which spawned the MTV-fueled hit &ldquoPull Me Under.&rdquo&nbsp The band then began a long association with Atlantic/East West, achieving substantial success with the albums <em>Images and Words</em>, <em>Awake</em>, <em>Falling into Infinity</em>, <em>Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory</em>, <em>Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence</em>, <em>Train of Thought</em> and <em>Octavarium</em>.&nbsp The group&rsquo;s skill and versatility expanded with the crucial additions of lead vocalist James LaBrie in 1991 and keyboardist Jordan Rudess in 1999.</p><br><p>Dream Theater&rsquos individualistic approach often put the band at odds with the methods of the major-label world.&nbsp But their dynamic recorded output and exciting, surprise-filled live shows nonetheless earned the group a large and uncommonly loyal worldwide audience.</p><br><p>&ldquoBeing on a major label never really felt like the right place for us, but they kept renewing our contract because our fan base was strong enough to justify it,&rdquo Portnoy says.&nbsp &ldquoThey tried to get us onto the radio, and tried to promote us through all of the traditional means, but we always felt like a round peg in a square hole.&rdquo</p><br><p>With 2007&rsquos acclaimed <em>Systematic Chaos</em>, Dream Theater moved to the more hospitable environment of Roadrunner Records.&nbsp The move yielded immediate results, with <em>Systematic Chaos</em> becoming the band&rsquos highest-charting album to date.&nbsp The album&rsquos release coincided with the publication of <em>Lifting Shadows</em>, an authorized biography recounting Dream Theater&rsquos first twenty years.</p><br><p>&ldquoOnce we came to Roadrunner, it really felt like home,&rdquo Portnoy states.&nbsp &ldquoI think they understand how to deal with a band like us, and they trust us to give us the space to do what we do.&rdquo</p><br><p>Dream Theater may well be the ultimate cult band, receiving relatively little mainstream exposure yet continuing to make music on their own terms while maintaining a large international fan following, whose devotion is anything but casual.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe&rsquore probably the only band that can fill Radio City Music Hall in New York or Wembley Arena in London or the Budokan in Tokyo and still not be a household name,&rdquo Portnoy notes.&nbsp &ldquoBut in some ways, that&rsquos worked in our favor, because we&rsquove never had to worry about being overexposed or being a flash in the pan.&nbsp Dream Theater fans are amongst the most hardcore, lifelong fans you&rsquoll ever see.&nbsp We have fans who follow us around on tour and rework their lives around our tour schedule, and now they&rsquore bringing their kids to the shows.&rdquo&nbsp</p><br><p>&ldquoIt definitely takes a certain attention span to be a Dream Theater fan,&rdquo Petrucci points out.&nbsp &ldquoThe fact that we use unusual arrangements and longer song lengths to develop ideas and tell a story can scare people off, because it&rsquos not party music that you can just put on in the background.&nbsp But the people who get it are passionate about it.&nbsp I think they appreciate that we never phone it in, and they know that they can expect something interesting from us.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoBeing a Dream Theater fan is a commitment, but I think that you get out of it what you put into it,&rdquo adds Portnoy, who oversees the archival official-bootleg and fan-club releases that the band regularly makes available to fans through the band&rsquos YtseJam label.&nbsp &ldquoNot everybody is willing to take the journey, but I think that if you&rsquore willing to invest the time, it&rsquos gonna be that much more fulfilling.&nbsp And the reward for us is having these fans that have really stuck by us and helped to sustain us.&rdquo</p><br><p>Dream Theater&rsquos restless creativity extends to their high-energy live shows, which have become more ambitious and diverse, as the band&rsquos career has progressed.&nbsp One distinctive aspect of Dream Theater&rsquos concerts is their ever-changing set list, which Portnoy oversees to ensure that no two shows are alike.</p><br><p>The band&rsquos fans have also enthusiastically supported a variety of adventurous side projects featuring Dream Theater members, including Liquid Tension Experiment, Explorers Club, MullMuzzler, OSI, Platypus, The Jelly Jam, Transatlantic and True Symphonic Rockestra.&nbsp But it&rsquo;s Dream Theater that commands the lion&rsquos share of the five musicians&rsquo attentions, and their longstanding creative rapport has never been more riveting than on <em>Black Clouds &amp Silver Linings</em>.&nbsp</p><br><p>&ldquoWe&rsquo;re in an amazing situation now, where we have complete creative freedom,&rdquo Portnoy concludes.&nbsp &ldquoWe can make any kind of record we want, and know that fans and our label will support it.&nbsp We&rsquore basically making records for ourselves and our fans, and not having to worry about what anyone else thinks.&nbsp It&rsquos taken 24 years to earn that, but now that we have, it&rsquos a great place to be.&rdquo</p>', 2007, NULL),

And he was just thirteen when New Orleans bluesman Bryan Lee brought him onstage to showcase his innate talent and already precision honed chops.

Kenny soon devised the idea of taking some of these guys on the road with his band - vocalist Noah Hunt, drummer Chris Layton, bassist Scott Nelson and keyboardist Riley Osbourn. They toured for two months, joined by&nbspHubert Sumlin, Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith, Buddy Flett and Bryan Lee.&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp&quot;We had such a great time that I decided we should capture some of it,&quot; Kenny says. &quot;I first intended on recording this just for my own private, personal benefit - just to have it for myself.

Thankfully, adrenaline took over as he stepped onstage. A breathtaking performance followed.&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp<em>Live in Chicago</em> features well-known staples from the Kenny Wayne Shepherd catalog alongside a batch of classic material chosen specially for these onstage collaborations. &quot;The music we played with these special guests actually isn&rsquo;t even the music from the <em>10 Days Out</em> project,&quot; Kenny says. &quot;It&rsquo;s a good balance.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbspThe respective&nbspr&eacutesum&eacutes of the guests on <em>Live in Chicago </em>read like a history book of blues and rock n&rsquo; roll.

However, KsE elected not to coast on the wave of prior successes, which saw them become one of the premier, most successful bands to emerge from the so-called New Wave of American metal. The band opted to work with an outside producer for the first time in their career. Brendan O&rsquo;Brien (AC/DC, Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots) was dispatched with the task, which saw the band record in locales other than their native Massachusetts.</p><br><p>&quot;We take so much care with the music,&quot; says bassist Mike D&rsquo;Antonio. &quot;We thought, &rsquo;Let&rsquo;s take things up a notch.&rsquo; Brendan liked the band and it made sense to collaborate with him.&quot; Jones also states, in his trademark self-deprecating humor, &quot;We&rsquo;re an easily identifiable band by our guitar tone, drums, and for better or worse, my voice.&quot; Jones challenged himself to explore a broader range of topics and to use his voice in other ways. &quot;You&rsquo;ll hear some things vocally that I&rsquo;ve never done,&quot; the singer says.&nbsp Jones also comments, &quot;You can count on anthems and positive lyrics, but hey, there&rsquo;s times when the sun isn&rsquo;t shining so brightly and some songs reflect that.&quot;</p><br><p>Guitarist and KsE class clown Adam Dutkiewicz, known for his crazy, hilarious stage antics, who co-produced <em>Killswitch Engage, </em>concurs, saying, &quot;We wanted to redefine who we are a little bit. We did that by taking time to write together instead of showing up and putting parts together. We felt our last record, <em>As Daylight Dies,</em> sounded a little too much like &rsquo;us,&rsquo; if that makes sense. We want to reinvent ourselves while retaining the Killswitch Engage integrity.&quot; While so many bands approach Dutkiewicz to produce their records, asking him for that definable &quot;KsE sound,&quot; the goofy guitarist is modest about his work, saying, &quot;I guess we&rsquo;re doing something right. We like to sound good on record. Live, there might be some hijinx and too much to drink, but that&rsquo;s the rock show. When we put songs together on record, we want them to sound clean and the best they can be!&quot;</p><br><p>Dutkiewicz maintains that despite the bands change of routine, things were exciting in the camp. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want things to be a ho-hum. I want to be over the top,&quot; he says. &quot;We have attained a stature where we can afford to take risks now. That&rsquo;s not to say we will be a polka band or anything, but we can take risks, make good music and make fans happy or we will be out of jobs very quickly.&quot;</p><br><p>Quality music is the order of the day on <em>Killswitch Engage. </em>The band also wrote in a much more collaborative way. D&rsquo;Antonio says, &quot;Everyone pulled together as a team when we were writing and everyone contributed songs, which doesn&rsquo;t always happen on Killswitch records. I&rsquo;m spreading some of my Southern rock influence into the band. There was a little on the last record but there is more now. It&rsquo;s slow, dirgey, heavy stuff.&quot;</p><br><p>Drummer Justin Foley was able to contribute more to the process, saying, &quot;I didn&rsquo;t do any over thinking with my parts. When I did <em>Heartache,</em> I was so new to the band that I was fitting into the band&rsquo;s mold and a lot of my crazy playing style doesn&rsquo;t work with Killswitch, so I had to adopt a new mindset. On <em>Daylight</em>, I may have overthought. This time, I&rsquo;m so comfortable and know what we are, so the parts were natural this time around.&quot;</p><br><p>Joel Stroetzel, the unsung hero of KsE who serves as the quiet force and complement to Dutkiewicz&rsquo;s showmanship, reflects on the band&rsquo;s career, saying, &quot;It&rsquo;s been a strange, long road. We didn&rsquo;t expect it in the beginning. It started as a weekend thing, with us jamming on Saturdays and playing occasional shows at bars, pubs, VFW halls.&nbsp It turned into more than we expected.&quot; For the new album, both guitarists experimented with sounds, tones and effects pedals, according to Stroetzel.&nbsp &quot;There&rsquo;s some more spacey, ambient stuff in the background, but not in the main parts,&quot; he says. &quot;It&rsquo;s heavy and guitar-driven, but it&rsquo;s a lot more textured.&quot;</p><br><p>Again, Jones contends that the change of pace was &quot;by no means easy, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the process. I like the challenge, that&rsquo;s one of the most enjoyable things about being in a band, getting to be creative in a way that a lot people don&rsquo;t get to be in normal, every day jobs.&quot; As for the impact KsE have left on the current hard rock scene, Jones and the band are modest, humble even, about their role.&nbsp Jones says, &quot;It&rsquo;s completely unexpected and in a lot of ways, not that much has changed about the band except we&rsquo;re not in a van anymore. It&rsquo;s still the same lunkheaded guys who get on stage and make fun of each other. Nothing has really changed, except we have a few more people who like us and we&rsquo;re lucky.&quot; While the band chalks it up to luck, talent and the crafting of good music that speaks to the fans also factor into the mix with Killswitch Engage and their new self-titled release<em>. </em></p>', 2002, NULL),

About survival of spirit unbowed, uniquely American, stubbornly resolute.</p><br><p>With their first set of new studio material since 2003&rsquos <em>Vicious Cycle</em>, legendary rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd returns with <strong><em>God &amp Guns</em></strong>, due out September 29 on <strong>Loud &amp Proud/Roadrunner Records</strong>. Recorded in Nashville in 2008-2009, the project was interrupted&mdashbut, tellingly, not ended&mdashby the deaths of founding member/keyboardist <strong>Billy Powell</strong> and longtime bassist <strong>Ean Evans</strong> earlier this year.</p><br><p>Driven by core members <strong>Gary Rossington</strong> (guitar), <strong>Johnny Van Zant</strong> (vocals) and <strong>Rickey Medlocke</strong> (guitar), along with longtime drummer <strong>Michael Cartellone</strong>, Lynyrd Skynyrd have recorded an album (&ldquounder duress, as usual,&rdquo according to Van Zant) that very much lives up to the legacy begun some 35 years ago in Jacksonville, Florida, and halted for a decade by the 1977 plane crash that killed three band members, including Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines. Since then, the band tragically lost Allen Collins, Leon Wilkeson and Huey Thomasson, yet they rock on.</p><br><p>With the passing of Powell and Evans, &ldquoa lot of people probably expected us to say enough is enough,&rdquo admits Medlocke.&nbsp But that would not be the way of this Rock &amp Roll Hall of Fame powerhouse. With a catalog of over 60 albums and sales beyond 30 million, Lynyrd Skynyrd remains a cultural icon that appeals to all generations, and <em>God &amp Guns</em> is a fitting addition to the canon. The <em>Skynyrd Nation</em> awaits.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe wanted to show the people that not only are we doing the old material, keeping the music going, but we still have some new tricks up our sleeves, too,&rdquo says founding guitarist Gary Rossington.</p><br><p>Returning to the studio after the death of Powell, whose keyboards can be heard on more than half the songs on <em>God &amp Guns</em>, was &ldquovery difficult, I ain&rsquot gonna lie to you,&rdquo says Van Zant. &ldquoBut we got through it, as Lynyrd Skynyrd seems to always do. Music&rsquos a great healer. These songs needed to be out there, this record needed to be made. Gary, Rickey and myself just said &lsquolet&rsquos go for it, let&rsquos get this thing done.&rsquo&rdquo</p><br><p>Unfortunately, coping with loss is familiar to this band. &ldquoWe just kind of fell back in,&rdquo says Rossington. &ldquoWe&rsquove been doing this a long time, so you just kind of do what you do. As you get older, you get a little more used to it. You know it&rsquos coming, and it&rsquos coming to you, too. I just thank God for every day and all the time I had with the guys that aren&rsquot with us anymore.&rdquo</p><br><p>The crying is over and now it&rsquos time to rock. &ldquoWe&rsquove had some really bad moments this year already, and I&rsquom glad we&rsquore able to pick ourselves up by our boot straps and just continue to play,&rdquo says Medlocke. &ldquoFor us to weather through this makes this record even more special. I&rsquom sure Billy and Ean are looking down upon us with big smiles.&rdquo</p><br><p>With noted rock producer <strong>Bob Marlette</strong>, input from guitarist <strong>John 5</strong>, and a wealth of material written by the band and a cadre of elite Skynyrd-minded songwriters, a remarkable album emerged. &ldquoWe never really worked with producers that well, we kind of always wanted to do it our way,&rdquo admits Rossington. &ldquoBut Bob Marlette came on and he&rsquos such a great guy he figured out how to talk to us musically, and we became friends instantly. He had a lot of fresh ideas and ways to do things, and also wanted to capture the old sounds, too.&rdquo</p><br><p>Of John 5, Rossington adds, &ldquohe&rsquos probably one of the best guitar players I&rsquove ever played with, and I&rsquove played with a lot of great ones. He just lives with a guitar on him, and he knows that neck like nobody I&rsquove ever seen.&rdquo</p><br><p>With a backbone of Southern rock and country, passionate Van Zant vocals, and trademark layered guitars, <em>God &amp Guns</em> manages to maintain the iconic Skynyrd punch while sounding completely contemporary. Sure to attract attention in these politically divided times is the title track, which harbors a sense of menace and unwillingness to back down that hearkens back to Skynyrd&rsquos earliest days. The band knows the song, and others like &ldquoThat Ain&rsquot My America,&rdquo will have their critics, but Medlocke says listeners should get beyond the title.</p><br><p>&ldquoIt&rsquos not just the words &lsquoGod and guns.&rsquo you gotta look past that and look at what this country was founded on: freedom,&rdquo Medlocke says. &ldquoEverybody should be able to make their own decisions and not be led around by a nose ring and told what to do and when to do it.&rdquo</p><br><p>And if some critics don&rsquot like it, &ldquothat&rsquos called freedom of choice,&rdquo says Medlocke, who carries his Native American heritage with pride. &ldquoI&rsquom sure some critics will look at it, <em>God &amp Guns</em>, the rednecks are back.&rsquo Well, the guys in this band aren&rsquot rednecks, Rickey Medlocke&rsquos the only damn redneck in this band &lsquocause I got red skin.&rdquo</p><br><p>The title track, along with the unmistakable Skynyrd bite of the first single &ldquoStill Unbroken,&rdquo form thematic songs for an album laden with attitude, heart and purpose. &ldquoSkynyrd&rsquos about tradition,&rdquo says Medlocke. &ldquoWe are guys that don&rsquot go around preaching about our own personal or political beliefs, although I&rsquom sure you could probably guess mine. In this record is personal tragedy, personal relationships and being on the road, all under that umbrella of real life. That&rsquos what we think, that&rsquos what we believe, and we stand next to that title, <em>God &amp Guns</em>.&rdquo</p><br><p>To portray Skynyrd as a bunch of &ldquogun nuts&rdquo would be incorrect, according to Van Zant. &ldquoI&rsquom kind of like Ronnie, &lsquohandguns are made for killing,&rsquo and I&rsquove never seen anybody shoot a deer with a .38,&rdquo he says. &ldquoI do own a bunch of rifles, I live out in the swamp, and you&rsquove got to protect yourself.&rdquo</p><br><p>Skynyrd is a band, after all, that has never shied away from standing up and speaking for a segment of the population whose voices are seldom heard. &ldquoEverybody&rsquos so scared to say stuff these days, that&rsquos not what I&rsquom about,&rdquo says Van Zant. &ldquoWe live in America, we can speak our minds. These are our values. That doesn&rsquot mean we&rsquore always right in everybody&rsquos mind. Hopefully, we don&rsquot offend a bunch of people. And if we do, well, get a record deal, man, and make your own songs.&rdquo</p><br><p>This is a band well aware of the responsibility that comes with putting the name &lsquoLynyrd Skynyrd&rsquo on anything, be it an album or a concert. &ldquoWe feel like we have to keep the standards high,&rdquo says Rossington. &ldquoI wouldn&rsquot put this record out, I&rsquod fight not to, if I didn&rsquot think it was good.&rdquo</p><br><p>And so Skynyrd stands, &ldquostill unbroken,&rdquo in 2009. &ldquoPeople may say, &lsquothey need the money,&rsquo well I don&rsquot think any of us need the money,&rdquo Van Zant says. &ldquoIt&rsquos just that we love the music, it&rsquos bigger than the money, it&rsquos not even about that any more. We have to make a living, sure, but it&rsquos about the legacy of Lynyrd Skynyrd, and what it stands for, what the fans are all about. There&rsquos nothing like getting out there playing a great show with Skynyrd and seeing people love this music.&rdquo</p><br><p>Adds Rossington, &ldquoWe&rsquore still standing, still keeping the music going. We wanted to do the guys who aren&rsquot with us any more proud, and keep the name proud, too.&rdquo</p>', 2009, NULL),
(20, 'Machine Head', '                             How do you create a masterpiece of modern metal?&nbsp Is it a conscious effort on the part of the artists or is it something more organic - a confluence of events and moods, emotions and mechanics that all come together in the right place at the right time?&nbsp That&#39s the question that comes to mind upon the first listen to <strong>Machine Head</strong>&#39s sixth studio album <em><strong>The Blackening</strong>.&nbsp </em>Guitars rip, drums pound, bass thunders and lyrics resonate as the Bay Area quartet soars past the bar set by its critically-lauded predecessor <em><strong>Through the Ashes of Empires</strong>.&nbsp </em>If <em><strong>Empires</strong> </em>was the sounding of the trumpet, then <em><strong>The Blackening</strong> </em>is the arrival of the hordes: dense, aggressive and inescapable. <p>Produced once again by singer/guitarist Robb Flynn&nbsp(<strong>Roadrunner United</strong>, <strong>Machine Head</strong>) and mixed by Colin Richardson (Bullet For My Valentine, Funeral For A Friend), <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em> pushes the band&#39s groundbreaking sound farther than it&#39s ever gone before.&nbsp Challenging themselves and each other to write a record that would demolish all of their boundaries, the band has delivered 60 minutes of the most structurally complex and technical material that <strong>Machine Head</strong> has ever recorded.&nbsp Three part guitar and bass harmonies, dueling solos, and savage thrash intricacy sit alongside soaring 3 part vocal harmonies, ultimately crashing head first into bludgeoning, Neanderthal riffage. &quotPushing ourselves came pretty naturally with <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em>. &quotAfter writing&nbspsongs like &quotImperium,&quot &quotVim&quot and&nbsp&quotDays Turn Blue To Gray&quot on the last album,&nbspwe&nbspfelt really comfortable magnifying the complexity of our&nbspsongs and it really shows on this album,&quot exclaims drummer Dave McClain. That fact becomes brilliantly obvious after listening to just the first few minutes of album opener &quotClenching the Fists of Dissent.&quot&nbsp Yet, those &quotfirst few minutes&quot are merely a portion of what the ten-minute epic has in store for the listener, serving both literally and figuratively as the war cry for the record and setting the stage for the colossal statement that is <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em>.</p><p>Fighting alongside the band&#39s monstrous musical effort are Robb&#39s gritty, streetwise lyrics which teeter effortlessly between brutal metal shouting and lush, melodic singing.&nbsp Going from what has recently been a more introspective focus, the words that grace <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em> return to the socially-conscious narrative so prevalent throughout their earlier albums, focusing heavily on issues that touch one and all.&nbsp &quotThe nature of the times during the writing of this album led to a very dismal atmosphere throughout... this is far and away the darkest material that we&#39ve ever written&quot states Flynn.&nbsp With lyrics that refuse to tread lightly when it comes to politics, war and organized religion, Robb spits anger and disdain in the truest spirit of the angst that fueled early 80&#39s punk rock.&nbsp Songs such as the aforementioned opener &quotClenching the Fists of Dissent,&quot the massive &quotHalo&quot and epic album closer &quotA Farewell To Arms&quot attest to that fact.</p><p>Continuing the theme, &quotAesthetics of Hate&quot captures the band&#39s anger towards a story that surfaced right after the tragic death of Dimebag Darrell that bashed both the legendary guitarist and the metal community as a whole.&nbsp &quotNow I Lay Thee Down&quot plays like a twisted Romeo &amp Juliet with its own ugly ending. &quotSlanderous&quot addresses the hate and name-calling&nbspthat still permeates throughout society, even in today&#39s &quotPC&quot climate.&nbsp &quotBeautiful Mourning&quot speaks to the lowest of low points in a life, while &quotWolves&quot references the strength and power of the pack, speaking to Machine Head&#39s rabid fans as well as the band itself. </p><p>And with good reason to witness <strong>Machine Head</strong> live is to understand both their unique internal chemistry and the undeniable bond that the band shares with its audience. With a performance that has been honed and strengthened through nearly nine years of non-stop worldwide touring, <strong>Machine Head</strong> are touted by many as the best live band in metal. &nbspOftentimes one can barely hear the band perform over the din of the audience singing along to favorites, new and old alike. Tickets for the band&#39s recent sold-out U.K. tour elicited bids in excess of $300 per pair on eBay and had bootleggers selling rip-offs of frontman Robb Flynn&#39s coveted &quotFUCT&quot stage T-shirt.</p><p>One can fully appreciate the band&#39s current level of success by looking back on their less-than-glamorous beginnings:&nbsp beer-fueled rehearsals in an Oakland warehouse that they shared with 4 punk rock bands, playing their first parties, local shows (some members not even old enough at the time to get into the 21+ clubs they were booked in) with the likes of Rancid, Deftones and Napalm Death. To spread the word, <strong>Machine Head</strong> took guerrilla marketing into their own hands, relentlessly flyering high schools and stickering unsuspecting cars at metal and punk shows. The band&#39s first demo - recorded for $800 in a friend&#39s bedroom, with their amps in the bathroom - was a very rough estimation of their burgeoning sound, a combination of the aggression of metal and punk, and the social anger of urban rap, intertwined with hypnotic Alice In Chains-esque vocal harmonies. It was this demo that eventually made it into the hands of Roadrunner Records, setting into motion the course of events that would lead to the 1994 release of their groundbreaking debut, <em><strong>Burn My Eyes</strong></em>.</p><p>Resplendent with some of the heaviest guitar tones ever heard in metal (thanks to their pioneering use of a dropped B tuning, and Peavey 5150 amplifiers - virtually unknown prior to <em>BME</em>) and released the same year as such seminal albums as Pantera&#39s <em>Far Beyond Driven</em>, AFI&#39s <em>Answer That and Stay Fashionable</em> and In Flames&#39 <em>Subterranean</em>, <em><strong>Burn My Eyes</strong></em> crashed head-first into the then-barren metal world.&nbsp Critical praise overseas, combined with 17 months of non-stop touring (including 5 months with Slayer), a U.S. headline tour that had them booked at every pool hall, strip bar, and rock club in America, a European headline tour that had them booked in the very same venues they had just supported Slayer, <em><strong>Burn My Eyes</strong></em> went on to become the biggest-selling debut in the history of Roadrunner Records at the time, and would soon serve as the template for much of the &#39metalcore&#39 sound that dominates the aggressive music market today.&nbsp </p><p>Their annihilating follow-up <em><strong>The More Things Change...</strong></em> would see the band expand their trademark sound, pushing the envelope even further. Several high-profile tours in America followed, including Ozzfest (which saw the band flirt with expulsion after starting an on-stage grass-throwing riot in Detroit), firmly established Machine Head as a live draw to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, the bands&#39 hard drinking reputation and dependence on alcohol and drugs began to get the best of them.&nbsp Then-guitarist Logan Mader would quit the band, and Flynn would enter therapy soon afterward to deal with his own problems.<br /><br />Choosing to face his demons head on, the frontman confronted his issues through his lyrics. Rather than lashing out at society, he exorcised his own personal demons, purging his psychological wounds on the emotionally-charged shockwave that was their 3rd album,<em> <strong>The Burning Red</strong></em>.&nbsp Flynn&#39s confessions on the songs &quotFive&quot and &quotThe Burning Red&quot were lyrical scars torn wide open, revealing dark truths that he had yet to even share with many of his closest friends. This heightened lyrical heft lent itself to even greater musical experimentation, with the band incorporating such lesser known influences as The Cure, and the guitar psychedelics of Jimi Hendrix into their healthy dose of metal.&nbsp Bassist Adam Duce agrees, &quot<em><strong>The Burning Red</strong></em> was a brave and pretty bold step forward.&nbsp We felt like we had kind of backed ourselves into a corner after <em><strong>The More Things Change...</strong></em>, so we decided to take some risks, screw playing it safe.&quot&nbsp The risk paid off, with <em><strong>The Burning Red</strong></em> allowing <strong>Machine Head</strong> to expand its fan base outside of the metal genre in the U.S., and abroad.&nbsp Subsequent tours of the U.S., and again more dates with Slayer in such far-away places as Korea, Japan, Australia, and Europe,&nbspwould take the band to previously un-scaled heights.</p><p>While the band&#39s 4th effort <em><strong>Supercharger</strong></em> would produce such live concert favorites as &quotBulldozer&quot and the harrowing &quotTrephination&quot - a fact solidly reinforced on their follow-up live album <em><strong>HellaLive</strong></em> (recorded at a sold-out 5000-capacity concert at London&#39s Brixton Academy) - as well as include two U.S. headlining tours, their first-ever festival headlining appearance at Germany&#39s With Full Force Festival, and a slot at Japan&#39s &quotBeast Feast&quot festival, both the band and fans alike felt that <strong>Machine Head</strong> could push themselves harder, challenging themselves to forge something that was once again fresh and innovative.</p><p>Enter 2003&#39s <em><strong>Through the Ashes of Empires</strong></em>.&nbsp Hailed by critics and fans alike as a metal masterpiece, <em><strong>Through the Ashes of Empires</strong></em> went on to become the 2nd-best selling record for Roadrunner Records Europe that year.&nbsp Six months later in the Spring of 2004, the album saw its U.S. release, also via Roadrunner. The album debuted at #88 on the Billboard Top 200 (tying <strong>Machine Head</strong>&#39s highest debut ever) and their follow-up live DVD <em><strong>Elegies</strong></em> bullied its way to #13 on the U.S. Billboard charts, and #4 on the U.K. charts.&nbsp Their three U.S. headline tours of clubs and small theaters (garnering a direct support slot for Lamb Of God on select U.S. dates) and their two European headline tours of large and small theaters achieved stellar numbers, selling out nearly all shows in major markets throughout both continents. The band&#39s European summer festival run included blistering appearances at Germany&#39s Rock Am Ring / Rock Am Park (as direct support to Korn and Evanescence), a show-stealing Donington performance as direct support to Slipknot and Metallica, prompting fans to vote <strong>Machine Head</strong> &quotBest Band of the Day&quot on Download&#39s official U.K. website, and finally, a headlining slot atop Germany&#39s prestigious Wacken festival (with the fans once again electing <strong>Machine Head</strong> &quotBest Band of the Festival&quot on Wacken&#39s official website), would wrap up what was nothing short of a spectacular run for the band. </p><p>Little did anyone know what they had in store... with lead guitarist Phil Demmel firmly entrenched in the ranks, and drummer Dave McClain practicing upwards of 7 hours a day, the band re-entered the studio with a near-insatiable hunger and new thirst to create.&nbsp Guitarist Phil Demmel notes, &quotSince I was only in the band long enough to&nbspcontribute to a few songs for &#39<em><strong>Ashes</strong></em>&#39, I really wanted to put a signature Flynn/Demmel stamp on this albums&#39 material. &nbspWe really pushed each other with the riff interplay and the harmony solos to a&nbsphigh point in this bands&#39 history.&quot&nbsp Singer/guitarist Robb Flynn echoes that sentiment, stating that &quotIn many ways this was the most important record of our career. We needed to make a record that was fearless in its ability to embrace, but not be limited by what we had accomplished before. &nbspAll of our musical heroes have made monumental records that didn&#39t necessarily go with the evolution of their band a perfect example would be The Cure from <em>Pornography</em> to <em>Disintegration</em>, or Metallica from <em>Kill &lsquoem All</em> to <em>Master of Puppets</em>. Those bands destroyed their drawing board and reconstructed it.&quot </p><p>And it is that fearlessness that has allowed <strong>Machine He</strong>ad to make music that is daring, true and honest.&nbsp Never creating the same album twice, they&#39ve stuck their necks out numerous times, always looking to push the envelope just a little further.&nbsp And while any time you take a risk, some results may fare better than others, there&#39s one thing you can always be sure of - the <strong>Machine Head</strong> album you&#39re listening to is the album they wanted to create. Compromise has never been an option for <strong>Machine Head</strong>.&nbsp With <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em>, that same creed of indomitable passion and unflinching sincerity has brought us the genuine article, having yet again set a new high watermark for themselves as well as the genre.&nbsp Don&#39t let the name fool you... <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em> is, without a doubt, <strong>Machine Head</strong>&#39s brightest moment.</p>', 1994, NULL),

(22, 'Meat Loaf', '                             <p>Some people think big. Some people think huge. And then there&rsquo;s Meat Loaf.<br /> <br /> For the past 35 years, the man born Marvin Lee Aday has been a towering monument on the musical landscape.&nbsp His legendary 1977 album <strong>Bat Out Of Hell</strong> transformed this former high school football player, nightclub bouncer and stage actor into one of the great American rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll icons. That record, with its staggering operatic sound and impassioned vocals, has sold more than 43 million albums worldwide - still one of the biggest-selling records of all time.<br /> <br /> Meat Loaf&rsquo;s reputation as one of music&rsquo;s greatest artists was underlined by such masterpieces as <strong>Dead Ringer</strong> (1981), <strong>Bad Attitude</strong> (1984) and the <strong>Bat Out Of Hell </strong>sequels <strong>Bat Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell</strong> (1993) and <strong>Bat Out Of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose </strong>(2006). Other artists might have tried to match his scale and copy his sound, but no one has come close.</p><br><p><br /> Now, more than 30 years after he exploded onto the world stage, Meat Loaf is back with a new record, <strong>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</strong> (a title taken from a line in the classic Russ Meyer trash movie &ldquoBeyond The Valley Of The Dolls&rdquo). From opener &ldquoPeace On Earth&rdquo to closer &ldquoElvis In Vegas,&rdquo its 13 tracks drag the classic Meat Loaf sound kicking and screaming into the 21st century.<br /> <br /> &quot;I wanted it big, I wanted it dramatic, I wanted a rock record,&quot; says Meat Loaf. &quot;Yes, it sounds like a Meat Loaf record. But it sounds different too - it sounds new, it sounds fresh. It speaks to you in a different way.&quot;<br /> <br /> Much of this newfound energy can be put down to Meat Loaf&rsquo;s working relationship with his new collaborator, producer Rob Cavallo (Green Day, My Chemical Romance Paramore, Fleetwood Mac). For the singer, it was a chance to work with one of the hottest producers around. For Cavallo, it was an opportunity to work with a childhood hero and a proper rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll legend.<br /> <br /> &quot;Rob is the Number 1 rock producer in the world because he leaves his ego out of the equation and gives an artist his voice, making it sound better than the artist could even imagine,&quot; says Meat. &quot;I was like a fisherman looking for a big mouthed bass. I put on the right worm. The first song I played to him, I hooked him. The second song, I nailed him.&quot;<br /> <br /> The pair hit it off immediately, and this electrifying creative partnership immediately raised the bar several feet. Meat Loaf brought more than 40 songs to the table, which the duo whittled down to the 13 that appear on the final record, including the furious &ldquoLiving On The Outside&rdquo and hilarious &ldquoLosAngeloser.&rdquo<br /> <br /> But there was one other piece to the jigsaw: Los Angeles-based screenwriter and director Kilian Kerwin, a long-time friend of the singer. As with every classic Meat Loaf album, <strong>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</strong> has a bigger concept. It was one of Kerwin&rsquo;s short stories that inspired the singer to come up with the album&rsquo;s striking narrative.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&rsquo;s the story of a soldier,&quot; reveals Meat Loaf. &quot;He&rsquo;s been in battle and he&rsquo;s lying face down on the ground. He can&rsquo;t move, but he turns his head and starts to see blood run across the ground, and so he thinks he&rsquo;s going to die. They always say you see your life flash backwards you when you&rsquo;re about to die. But his life flashes forward - into what possibly could happen. He sees what his life could be - the good and the bad. The songs are the different scenarios he finds himself in. It&rsquo;s not always the same time or the same place - but it&rsquo;s always the same woman. But I don&rsquo;t want to give too much away - I want people to work it out for themselves.&quot;<br /> <br /> To flesh out his vision, Meat Loaf enlisted a set of elite musicians to play on the album, including guitarists Tim Pierce, Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins (who co-wrote two songs for the album),&nbspPaul Crook and Randy Flowers, legendary bass players Chris Chaney and Kasim Sulton, genius keyboardist Jamie Mulhoberac and the world&rsquos greatest rock drummer&nbsp(just ask Rob Cavallo) John Micelli. &nbsp<strong>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</strong> also features a stellar array of big-name guests, including Steve Vai (who appears on &ldquoLove is Not Real&rdquo), former Queen guitarist Brian May (who appears on &ldquoSong Of Madness&rdquo and &ldquoLove Is Not Real&rdquo), American Idol presenter Kara DioGuardi (who co-wrote and sings on &ldquoIf I Can&rsquo;t Have You&rdquo) and Hollywood star Jack Black, who duets with Meat Loaf on &ldquoLike A Rose.&rdquo&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>But the most surprising guest is Hugh Laurie - the English actor famous for starring in <em>Blackadder</em> and hit US TV show <em>House</em>. It was while making a guest appearance on the latter that Meat Loaf met Laurie and discovered that he was a classically-trained pianist. What else could he do but ask the actor to play piano on the song &ldquoIf I Can&rsquo;t Have You?&rdquo<br /> <br /> &quot;He was really nervous at first,&quot; recalls Meat Loaf. &quot;It was strange seeing someone so confident on a TV set walk into the studio like he&rsquo;s a quivering mess. But he nailed it. He&rsquo;s talking about playing it with us if we ever go on <em>American Idol</em>.&quot;</p><br><p><br /> &quot;What I love about&nbspHugh, Jack and Kara,&quot; says Meat Loaf. &quot;Is that sometimes you get people coming to the studio, and they have their manager and a bodyguard and an entourage - it&rsquo;s this endless stream of people. The 3 of them, they just drove up to the studio in their own cars, no bullshit no fronts, just real people. &nbspAnd I love real people.&quot;<br /> <br /> But for all the star guests, <strong>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</strong> is Meat Loaf&rsquo;s album &ndash his own dirty little secret. More than four decades into his career, the man - and his voice - is as big, bold and important as ever.<br /> <br /> &quot;How do I keep the fire burning?&quot; he asks. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know. I just do. I&rsquo;d bet in advance that if I sat with somebody in a room and said to them, &rsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you five pounds if you don&rsquo;t go &rsquo;Whoah!&rsquo; after the first song&rsquo;, they&rsquo;d forget about the five pounds and they&rsquo;d go &rsquo;Whoah!&rsquo;. You can&rsquo;t help it. And it&rsquo;s like that across all the songs. This record is spectacular!&quot;</p>', 2010, NULL),
(23, 'Megadeth', '                             <p>It&rsquos a rare thing when a musician comes face to face with what made them great to begin with.&nbsp <strong><em>ENDGAME</em></strong> is that moment for <strong>Dave Mustaine</strong> and <strong>Megadeth</strong>.&nbsp It&rsquos the record where it all comes full circle in a career that has set not only set standards in hard rock and metal, but defined them.&nbsp Megadeth are rage on a tight rein, as precise and beautifully destructive as a laser guided missile.&nbsp</p><br><p>&ldquoAfter the smoke had cleared from personnel and label changes, I knew that regaining respect for me and for Megadeth was going to be a huge undertaking,&rdquo says Mustaine of the process re-tooling Megadeth after what is considered the &ldquoclassic&rdquo line-up. &ldquoIt was much like trying to turn a battleship -- no, more like an aircraft carrier-- around.&rdquo</p><br><p>Mission accomplished on <em>ENDGAME, </em>which<em> </em>is as extreme as anything Megadeth has ever recorded. The album&rsquos signature track &ldquoHead Crusher&rdquo should not merely serve as a wake-up for old fans but also a new generation ready to keep Mustaine &amp Co.&rsquos brand of shredding guitar and bellicose songsmanship at the forefront of today&rsquos metal scene.</p><br><p>This, however, is not surprising for the man who has created and branded &ldquoGigantour,&rdquo which for the past three years has united some of metal&rsquos most musically literate players including Dream Theater, Children of Bodom and Opeth.&nbsp Then again, what else would one expect from someone who culled a sound from The New Wave of British Heavy Metal and created metal&rsquos then new chic, which was state of the art speed metal?</p><br><p>The Megadeth machine is built on a blueprint of stark, complex musicianship. Over time, with album sales nearing 25 million worldwide, Mustaine has balanced rabid-dog aggression with staggering song-craft. The albums <em>Killing Is My Business&hellipAnd Business Is Good!</em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>,</span> <em>Peace Sells&hellipBut Who&rsquos Buying?</em> , <em>So Far&hellipSo Good&hellipSo What?</em> and <em>Countdown to Extinction</em> remain true metal classics. No surprise then that Mustaine was awarded the title of &ldquoRiff Lord&rdquo at 2008&rsquos Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards in the U.K, or that he was crowned &ldquoGolden God&rdquo at the 2009 Revolver Golden Gods Awards in America.</p><br><p><br /> Which of course shouldn&rsquot negate the flirting with commercial success on <em>Youthanasia</em>, <em>Cryptic</em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;> </span><em>Writings</em> or <em>Risk</em>. Or even Megadeth&rsquos road back to the standing at the top of metal&rsquos top players with <em>World Needs a Hero</em>, <em>The System Has Failed</em> and their Roadrunner debut, <em>United Abominations</em>. &ldquoIt was a good lesson about the need to follow your heart,&rdquo says Dave of the creative process with <em>Endgame.</em> &ldquoI am grateful to have fans who have let me stretch my wings musically. But this is where I am most comfortable.&rdquo</p><br><p>At this point, Dave Mustaine has nothing to prove. To make the record he wanted, Mustaine found himself building a full-blown recording studio in San Marcos, California, just outside of San Diego, dubbed &ldquoVic&rsquos Garage&rdquo after Megadeth&rsquos&nbspiconic, skull-faced mascot Vic Rattlehead. His rationale for building a studio for Megadeth was simple: &ldquoWhen we went into the studio last time it was too expensive, too extravagant, too arrogant and I think it made us a little lazy,&rdquo muses Mustaine.</p><br><p>Andy Sneap,&nbspmetal-producer&nbspand mixer par-excellence and a Megadeth cohort from <em>United Abominations</em>,&nbspreturned to work alongside of Mustaine. The result of this metal-mongering synergy speaks for itself. &ldquoIt&rsquos a great relationship,&rdquo says Mustaine of his ongoing dealings with the acclaimed British producer, also known for his work with Killswitch Engage and Machine Head.&nbsp &ldquoWe had a few intense moments, but that is part of having a real working relationship. I am a better guitarist, singer and producer due to my tremendous respect for Andy and my open ears when he is listening or isn&rsquot listening to my point of view.&rdquo</p><br><p>Part of Megadeth&rsquos new energies on <em>ENDGAME </em>goes to the induction of guitarist Chris Broderick, who joins Mustaine, drummer Shawn Drover and bassist James LoMenzo in the &lsquoMegs tightest line-up in years.&nbsp Mustaine even went on record to say, &ldquoWith this album, I am also very excited to be introducing my new lead guitarist, Chris Broderick, to the world. I have always felt lucky to have had top shredders in that position, but after touring with Chris in support of my last album, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get into the studio and see what he could do.&quot;<br /> <br /> Not one to keep an exactly cheery lyrical stance, <em>ENDGAME </em>finds Mustaine more scalding and articulate than ever. Sure, there&rsquos &ldquo1,320&rdquo, a paean to the thrills of nitro funny car racing, but from there, it grows darker and darker. The Edgar Allen Poe waxing &ldquoThe Hardest Part of Letting Go&hellipSealed With A Kiss&rdquo finds the narrator entombing his beloved in a wall of bricks whilst Broderick shifts from beautific acoustics to Megadeth&rsquos riffy snarl.&nbsp</p><br><p>But it&rsquos a landscape of bitter realities where Mustaine&rsquos lyrics resonate. &ldquoBite The Hand That Feeds&rdquo and &ldquoThe Right To Go Insane&rdquo delve into an economically disenfranchised nation of have and have-nots. Mustaine himself is no stranger to politics, a self-admitted CNN junkie who in 1992 was MTV&rsquos floor commentator at the National Democratic Convention.</p><br><p><em>ENDGAME&rsquos</em> title track is Mustaine at his darkest. &quot;Thematically, I&rsquo;ve never been known to be a silent bystander in a world that needs our participation,&rdquo he says. &lsquoEndgame&rsquo specifically is a document signed into law that further strips away personal civil rights. &ldquoIt&rsquos a bill that George W. Bush had signed into law that could put an American citizen in a prison, much like a concentration camp,&rdquo states Mustaine. Far-fetched?&nbsp Surprisingly not.</p><br><p>Musically and lyrically&nbsp Dave Mustaine remains metal&rsquos true iconoclast whose latest musical offering rumbles with the intensity his career has been built on. Megadeth has come full circle. Megadeth are back to the killing business&hellipand business has never been better.</p>', 2007, NULL),
(24, 'Methods of Mayhem', '                             <p>It wasn&rsquot logical but it made complete sense. <strong>Tommy Lee</strong> has rocked every continent multiple times, he&rsquos sold millions of records with <strong>M&oumltley Cr&uumle</strong> and on his own he&rsquos done everything a musician dreams of doing. Except this: he&rsquod never made a record with <em>the entire world</em>. &ldquoThis really was one of the most incredible experiences I&rsquove had making a record, other than the first time I made a record - because there&rsquos nothing quite like popping your cherry!&rdquo <strong>Tommy</strong> says.&nbsp &ldquoThis record was the craziest thing ever. Parts were sent in from all over the world by people wanting to participate in the first once-in-a-lifetime global collaboration. It was insane dude!&rdquo</p><br><p>The result is the second <strong>Methods of Mayhem</strong> album, <strong><em>A Public Disservice Announcement</em></strong>, the first truly collaborative effort an artist of Tommy&rsquos magnitude has ever dared to attempt. The concept came easy, the execution did not - it took time, technology, patience and dedication. The first step was to set the parameters. <strong>Tommy</strong> and his team, including producer <strong>Scott Humphrey</strong>, singer-guitarist <strong>J3</strong> and others, wrote and recorded the songs, which ran the gamut from hard rock anthems to ballads to dance tracks. Then they made the core components of each song available for download on <a href=&quot;http://www.thepublicrecord.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;><strong>www.thepublicrecord.com</strong></a> to anyone who wished to add their playing or otherwise re-interpret the music however they saw fit. <strong>Tommy</strong> listened to every single submission that was uploaded, chose the best, and integrated the actual audio tracks into the album&rsquos final cuts.</p><br><p>&ldquoSome people were confused because no one has attempted anything like this before,&rdquo <strong>Tommy</strong> says. &ldquoI got a lot of emails asking me if they&rsquod get songwriting credit if their part was used. That wasn&rsquot the case, because all of these songs were already written and recorded.&rdquo&nbsp That&rsquos not to say that the many contributors will remain anonymous, however.&nbsp Every single musician whose part was used is credited and thanked on the album.&nbsp &ldquoCredit doesn&rsquot always happen in the music industry - or any industry - when you&rsquore starting out,&rdquo Tommy says.&nbsp &ldquoAnd it hardly ever happens the first time you do something. I&rsquove done plenty of things for the credit, not the check, so I made sure that all of the people who sent us things we used were called out for their work. Take it from me - credit lasts forever, money doesn&rsquot!&rdquo</p><br><p>The song files were made available on <strong>The Public Record</strong> on October 5th, 2009. By the end of the submission period in February, 2010, the page was viewed over 1 million times and over 10,000 submissions were uploaded. The music<strong> Tommy </strong>received was all recorded in ProTools, Logic or Garage Band. And if a would-be collaborator had none of those, they were able to download a program called Riff Works for free from the website.&nbsp What came back once the public got its hands on the raw ingredients was <em>truly</em> all over the map - just as <strong>Tommy</strong> had hoped.</p><br><p>There were techno tracks sent in from the foothills of Osaka, Japan, there were hand drum rhythms sent in from India and searing guitar solos sent from as close to home as San Diego. There were also plenty of sounds to confuse and boggle the mind. &ldquoSome crazy dude from Prague I think it was, sent in a spoken word track that had nothing at all to do with the song,&rdquo <strong>Tommy</strong> says. &ldquoIt was this bit about &lsquothe cow&rsquos moon being in the sky, parting the broken winds of the clouds of the sea.&rsquo I turned to my producer and was like, &lsquoI don&rsquot know what he&rsquos talking about but I want what he&rsquos got!&rsquo&rdquo</p><br><p>In his work outside of the <strong>Cr&uumle</strong>, <strong>Tommy</strong> always challenges himself musically, so the greatest side effect of this project was his exposure to so many new ideas. &ldquoWhen you hear something totally left field,&rdquo he says, &ldquoyou realize that someone is hearing the same song so differently than you are. It makes you think about how you wrote it - and there are pros and cons to that.&rdquo&nbsp One of the pros, was that the song<strong> &ldquoBack to Before,&rdquo</strong> which started out as a rock song, ended up as a dance song. &ldquoThis guy from France sent in this complete re-edit - he made it into a full-on dance track. Anyone who knows me at all knows I love dance music, so when I heard it, that was it! It threw the song into a full 360&deg. We pumped the brakes and started over.&rdquo</p><br><p><strong>Tommy</strong>, along with his producer and band listened to about 1500 submissions a week - over 200 a day.&nbsp For all of the memorable oddballs, there was an over-abundance of talent. &ldquoThere is a lot of undiscovered talent out there, from kids just getting started, to shirt-tuckers who have a 9 to 5 that just rock out in a bar band on the weekends. They don&rsquot want to be famous, but those guys are stars.&rdquo&nbsp <strong>Tommy</strong>&rsquos greatest reward, however, was the appreciation he received for giving those unsung heroes a chance. &ldquoI got so many emails thanking me for the opportunity,&rdquo he says. &ldquoI kept thinking of myself at 15. If Led Zeppelin had put tracks online and I&rsquod ripped a few beats in my parents garage, sent them in and they&rsquod used them? I would have died!&rdquo</p><br><p>Though the project is called <strong>Methods of Mayhem</strong>, it bears little resemblance to its first incarnation - except for the fact that it&rsquos unlike anything else you&rsquoll hear this year. &ldquoWhen I founded Methods in 1999, the whole purpose of the band was to be all over the place,&rdquo <strong>Tommy</strong> says. &ldquoAnd in keeping with that, this Methods isn&rsquot anything like the last one. There&rsquos no hip hop and there&rsquos no roster of guest stars. This time, it&rsquos me, my band, and the world.&rdquo&nbsp When <strong>Methods of Mayhem</strong> brings<strong> <em>A Public Disservice Announcement</em></strong> on tour to the public that helped make it later this year, expect more of the unexpected.&nbsp &ldquoThere&rsquos some technology out there right now video- and lighting-wise that is blowing my mind,&rdquo Tommy says.&nbsp &ldquoI do a rock band with M&oumltley. Methods is not going to be that kind of set up. I want something like Daft Punk but unique to this. I want a real robot playing bass. I want the show to start at the mixing board. I want to do everything you&rsquore not supposed to do and hope it works. This is going to be something else, something I&rsquove never done before - <em>that&rsquos</em> my goal.&rdquo</p><br><p>The album&rsquos highlights include the ominous techno of <strong>&ldquoParty Instructions,&rdquo</strong> the sexy, mechanical funk of <strong>&ldquoAll I Wanna Do,&rdquo</strong> the hilarious rave-up <strong>&ldquoDrunk Uncle Pete&rdquo</strong> and the propulsive intensity of<strong> &ldquoFight Song.&rdquo</strong>&nbsp One of the album&rsquos first singles, <strong>&ldquoTime Bomb,&rdquo </strong>however, is the jewel in the crown. The introspective rock anthem&rsquos infectious sing-along chorus will confound those who think they know what to expect from Tommy Lee - which is just what the doctor ordered.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p>', 2010, NULL);

Joey and Wednesday tear through unforgettable tracks like &quot;My Dark Place Alone,&rdquo &ldquoDeath Valley Superstars,&rdquo &ldquoSummertime Suicide&rdquo and &ldquoDrug Me To Hell,&rdquo to name a few. Even though Joey&rsquo;s live role in Murderdolls is axe-slinging, his one-of-a-kind drumming fuels the album. Produced by Zeuss [Hatebreed, Shadows Fall] <em>Women and Children Last</em> exists in an evil little place tucked somewhere in a back alley behind the thrash, glam, punk and arena rock super highways, and Murderdolls have arrived to rip pop culture a new one. All you can do is sing along while they haul off your daughter&hellip</p><br><p>Murderdolls began festering within the collective hard rock consciousness in 2002 when they dropped their debut, <em>Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls</em>. A sensation with fans and critics &ndashAllmusic said &ldquoCall it gutter-punk, glam rock, or hair metal, every style is displayed here in its despondent glory&rdquo&mdash the album debuted at #1 on Billboard&rsquos Heatseekers chart, despite the fact that the band played a mere 15 shows on U.S. soil.&nbsp A soundtrack appearance soon followed (<em>Freddy Vs Jason</em>).&nbsp Truly an international sensation, <em>Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls</em> achieved Silver status in the U.K., where the band was especially loved: television appearances, magazine covers and sold out shows in 5,000 capacity venues abounded. Burning bright and living up to their out-of-control image, the band toured the world for two years, then took a well-deserved break.&nbsp Joey returned to the studio and the road for two earth-shattering Slipknot records, <em>Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses</em> (2004) and <em>All Hope Is Gone</em> (2008). Meanwhile Wednesday continued to put out solo records independently and to play for his rabid fans all over the globe. While on tour with their respective bands, Joey and Wednesday often fielded the same question from fans: When will the Murderdolls be back?</p><br><p>After Jordison finished an extensive, 18-month world tour with Slipknot in 2009, there was no better time to revive the beast. He and Wednesday began texting back and forth, quoting <em>Raising Arizona </em>and <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre,</em> and the pair knew the chemistry remained.&nbsp They began to plot what would become <em>Women and Children Last </em>and were soon holed up in a Hollywood Hills studio in March 2010, with 25 days to record their second unholy offering. They instantly connected over eight years worth of demos and a flurry of new ideas. It was like no break had ever even occurred.</p><br><p>For Jordison, who is spending the summer of 2010 touring with Rob Zombie, this album is the start of something very important. &quot;I consider <em>Women and Children Last</em> the <em>first</em> Murderdolls record,&quot; exclaims the multi-instrumental mastermind. &quot;The music is so much heavier now. Murderdolls haven&rsquo;t lost the fun, crazy vibe, but the topics are smarter. <em>Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls</em> was like a sketch and this is the real painting.&quot;</p><br><p>To paint this picture with just the right palette of anger and insidiousness, Wednesday dug deep. &nbspHe declares, &quot;It&rsquo;s definitely personal. I&rsquo;ve been doing campy horror lyrics since I was 15-years-old, and I wanted to expand beyond that. For the new Murderdolls, I wanted to keep the humor and violence intact, but I wanted to show a different side of the band. I&rsquo;m singing about life this time, instead of Dracula. If you really want to get down to it, we&rsquo;re a sex-drugs-rock-n-roll band more than anything.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;Drug Me To Hell&quot; and &quot;Blood Stained Valentine&rdquo feature solos from none other than legendary M&oumltley Cr&uumle guitarist, Mick Mars. About working with Mars, Jordison states, &quot;He&rsquo;s always been my favorite member of M&oumltley Cr&uumle. He&rsquo;s just a really classy guy, and his guitar playing is so unique. We sent the songs to him, and he loved them. Before we knew it, he was in the studio tracking. The way he plays&mdashhis style&mdashis so different than anyone that I&rsquo;ve ever seen. He&rsquo;s like a demonic Jeff Beck.&quot; Wednesday elaborates, &quot;Every day around 6 o&rsquo;clock, we&rsquo;d have dinner and the M&oumltley Cr&uumle <em>Behind the Music</em> would be on VH1 Classic. So we had to call Mick for &rsquo;Blood Stained Valentine.&rsquo; It was really cool sitting next to this guy in the studio knowing that he wrote some of my favorite songs that were the soundtrack to most of my life. I&rsquo;ve always considered Mick Mars to be one of the true villains of rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll like Ozzy and Alice Cooper.

It is an active record.&rdquo That&rsquos how bassist Andrew &ldquoAJ&rdquo Jacobs, the sole founding member, effectively encapsulated what Mutiny Within and their self-titled debut are about. The resulting album, <em>Mutiny Within, </em>is the culmination of<em> </em>years of figuring it out, getting it together and finally making it work and it&rsquos all manifested in an album that is almost shocking in its technical prowess and its use of melody amid maelstrom.</p><br><p>Jacobs can sum up Mutiny Within&rsquos sound as &ldquoshred with clean vocals, with a little bit of screaming, metal riffs, accessible parts and a lot of melody. We wanted to get all the melody in there. That is the number one thing for us. We want the music to reach metal fans and beyond. We want to reach everyone in between.&rdquo</p><br><p>While these metal upstarts Mutiny Within may have started out as a Children of&nbsp Bodom cover band &ndash and they&rsquore not embarrassed to admit it since they did grow out of it quickly only to become their own shred-happy entity- the sextet truly stepped on the path to recognition when they started writing their own songs. With origins in the great state of New Jersey, known for producing some of the top, up and coming metal talent in recent years, Mutiny Within also demonstrated their ability to remain ahead of the curve by embracing technology (and we&rsquore not talking about the studio trickery kind) and social networking features to take their band to the next level.</p><br><p>Jacobs formed the band in 2002 and endured a turbulent yet typical early existence until he solidified the lineup. His younger brother Brandon actually plays guitar and was a mere 18-years-old when he recorded the album. Vocalist Chris Clancy was imported from England after the band discovered this talented vox over a YouTube video and now resides in New Jersey. This is a band, who with their self-titled debut, are on the verge of being the valedictorians of the <em>Guitar Hero </em>generation. They play with astonishing technical skill with a forward-thinking songwriting style that can be viewed as modernly progressive, but definitely not &ldquoprog.&rdquo The band&rsquos use of keyboards also elevates their sound above and beyond just another up and coming metal band.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe were looking for a vocalist and we saw a video of Chris singing, so we contacted him and asked him to try putting vocals over one of our songs,&rdquo Jacobs recalls. &ldquoHe was the first audition and he rocked it. It was perfect. The only problem was that he lived in England, but he took a risk, flew over and made it work. He lives in my house now.&rdquo Indeed, Mutiny Within keep things in the family, since the band practices in the basement of drummer Bill Fore, who lives a mere twenty minutes from the Jacobs&rsquo abode.</p><br><p>Once Clancy committed to making the trek across the pond- he had nothing else to lose as a 23-year-old English kid working at a T-Mobile store- this band of hungry, young turks, who play like a troupe of seasoned, shredding veterans, wrote a whopping 50 songs together, fuelling one another&rsquos creativity. The flurry of activity surrounding the band, including their enthrallingly intense live show, captured the attention of Roadrunner Records, which signed the band. After the signing, the band kept writing and eventually went to work with producer Jason Bieler. Clancy&rsquos college friend, Dan Bage, eventually joined the band in the middle of recording, which not only makes Mutiny Within an &nbspunintentionally &ldquointernational band,&rdquo but was a situation that invigorated them, too.&nbsp &ldquoDan was so good that it wasn&rsquot like we were in the middle of making the record and got a stranger,&rdquo Jacobs recalled. &ldquoIt was Chris&rsquo friend and the best guy for the job technically. He flew over, we threw him in the studio, and he did seven solos, wrote four verses and helped rewrite parts, so he is just as important to the band.&rdquo Clearly, Mutiny Within are a band that can be thrown into the crackling fires of chaotic situations and emerge stronger and more focused than before.</p><br><p>Clancy started singing when he was 15-years-old and consistently worked to hone his craft through noted vocal coach Melissa Cross, so he could truly learn to sing, which only adds to the depth of dynamics on <em>Mutiny Within. </em>He was not hesitant to abandon his native England in order to pursue his rock &lsquon roll and heavy metal dreams, either. Clancy said, &ldquoI wanted to do this since I was a kid and first started playing in bands. I got myself in a band in Wales and then I dropped my social life there and abandoned my friends to write music and to practice, but that didn&rsquot go past the interest stage, so it wasn&rsquot a hard decision to come to America. I quit the job, got on a flight and came over. I spent my life trying to be in a band. That was always my plan, so I told myself if I have to move to do it, I&rsquoll do it.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoWe have all these technical guys who can play so many types of music and have so many different tastes, so for those 50 songs, we went around the world and back,&rdquo Jacobs says.&nbsp Obviously, not all 50 songs made the cut, but the sheer numbers demonstrate the band&rsquos abilities and range. &ldquoThe 11 songs we picked for the record are our best songs,&rdquo Jacobs adds.</p><br><p>The band was introduced to the metal world in Fall 2009, via their first national tour with Soulfly, Prong and Cattle Decapitation, in addition to the dozens of local, hometown shows they&rsquove logged and tucked under their belts and will spend much of the year following the release of<em> Mutiny Within </em>touring and turning heads.</p><br>The opening track &ldquoAwake&rdquo is one which defines the band&rsquos sound, with Jacobs saying, &ldquowe get more diverse, with different keys, tempos and styles throughout, but that&rsquos the song that defines our sound.&rdquo&nbsp&nbsp &ldquoReflections&rdquo is another band favorite, thanks to its unforgettable melodies. &nbspWhile Jacobs says that &ldquoForsaken&rdquo is the song where &ldquowe stepped outside the box to show a different side of the band, with clean guitars.&rdquo<ol> </ol><br><p>It appears as though the Mutiny Within story is just beginning and that the ins and outs of their formation will lead to a happy ending. &ldquoWe dedicated our whole lives to this,&rdquo Jacobs said. &ldquoTwo guys dropped their lives in England and didn&rsquot know if it would work, since we weren&rsquot even signed at the time, but we had that dedication to do it.&rdquo<br /> <br /> Certainly, Mutiny Within aren&rsquot a traditional band, having used technology and the Internet to their benefit and thus forcing the band to work in different ways.&nbsp &ldquoMost bands get in a van, go out, play, tour, tour, tour,&rdquo Jacobs said. <br /> &ldquoWe&rsquore at that chapter now. The focus for us was always just writing songs. That&rsquos been our lives. We played 30 shows with Chris and then got signed. We made every song as special as the next. Each track has lots of time put into it. We were a band that aspired to get a deal and make records, so we made the focus of efforts the songs.&rdquo</p><br><p>Mission accomplished on <em>Mutiny Within: </em>11 songs that usher in a new generation of metal.</p>', 2010, NULL),

They blend soaring keyboards and operatic vocals with shredding guitars and jagged rhythms for a style of cinematic, orchestral heavy music all their own.&nbsp The Finnish quintet has remained a force in the European scene for the last decade, but with their second <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong> release <strong><em>Dark Passion Play</em></strong>, they are destined to captivate metal fans across the entire globe.&nbsp Filling vocalist Tarja Turunen&#39s vacant spot with newcomer <strong>Anette Olzon</strong>, the band is now stronger than ever. They have also crafted a record that&#39s heavy, hypnotic and downright powerful.</p>    <p>Nightwish&#39s style has established them as one of the premier female-fronted metal bands. With overpowering keyboard tones reminiscent of classic film scores, the band separates itself. Their combination of seductive, emotional vocals and gallant guitar melodies brings to mind both Evanescence and Iced Earth. Yet, Nightwish have crafted a distinct sound. Their 1997 debut <em>Angels Fall Fast</em> introduced the world to this sound, propelled by the strength of the single &quotThe Carpenter.&quot The follow-up <em>Oceanborn</em> would secure a spot in the Finnish Top Five and spawn three chart-topping singles.&nbsp In 2000, <em>Wishmaster </em>cemented the band&#39s rabid fan following and led to their first U.S. distribution. However, a hard-hitting fourth offering <em>Century Child</em> added bassist and backing vocalist <strong>Marco Hietela</strong> to the fold, and it yielded some of the band&#39s heaviest and darkest tracks up to that point. Nightwish embraced their metallic and classical influences to the fullest and completely established themselves.</p>    <p>In 2004, the band&#39s first Roadrunner Records release and fifth studio effort <strong><em>Once</em></strong><em> </em>would gain them a foothold in the U.S.&nbsp They launched a hotly-anticipated tour in The States, packing sold-out theaters across the country. Over the course of the year, <em>Once </em>surpassed sales of one million units worldwide.&nbsp The album featured the single <strong>&quotNemo,&quot</strong> with an entrancing video courtesy of director <strong>Antti Jokinen</strong> (Eminem). <em>Once </em>eventually garnered the band five awards at the <strong>Finnish Grammy Awards</strong> including both <strong>&quotBand of the Year&quot</strong> and <strong>&quotThe Best Selling Album of the Year.&quot</strong>&nbsp These accolades would solidify Nightwish as an international force.</p>    <p>After a highly successful world tour in 2005, the band underwent a drastic lineup change. They severed ties with Tarja via an open letter. Fans and the media clamored for a replacement, and questions ran rampant. Though most artists might not be able to recover from a split like this, Nightwish aren&#39t most artists. The band would check out over 2,000 applications from singers worldwide until they found Anette Olzon. Upon her first visit to Finland, Anette met the band and immediately clicked with them. They announced her addition shortly after. The sexy Swedish singer elevates Nightwish to the next level with a dynamic voice that breathes charisma and life into the new songs. </p>      <p>Even with the absence of Tarja, Nightwish has crafted an epic, infectious and potent sixth release in the form of <strong><em>Dark Passion Play</em></strong>. <strong>Tuomas Holopainen&#39s</strong> keys create huge melodies that are deep, gothic and sensual, while <strong>Emppu Vuorinen&#39s</strong> guitars hit with an urgent crunch. The record represents the culmination of the band&#39s evolution and success. It&#39s a dark, yet infectious journey, featuring all of the elements that fans love about Nightwish-from the symphonic keyboards to the divine melodies. At the forefront of the new music is Anette.&nbsp Her voice hypnotizes with a diverse range, complementing both the metallic guitars and orchestral keys perfectly. The new songs are some of Nightwish&#39s most adventurous and powerful. Leadoff single <strong>&quotBye Bye Beautiful&quot</strong> starts with a precise, calculated riff locked in with warm electronic keys. Then the song launches into vibrant vocal interplay between Anette and Marco with an incendiary and catchy chorus. <strong>&quot7 Days to the Wolves&quot</strong> features galloping guitars with swirling orchestrations and visual lyrics that captivate.&nbsp On <strong>&quotMaster Passion Greed,&quot</strong> epic riffs and keyboards create an inviting, yet intense embrace.&nbsp Heavy guitars crescendo into an incredible vocal explosion.&nbsp Meanwhile, <strong>&quotAmaranth&quot</strong> has a power metal rhythm that builds with a serious urgency. </p>  <p>However, Nightwish have further experimented, embracing their new singer&#39s immense talent and venturing beyond the norm. &quotEva&quot highlights Anette&#39s versatility, allowing her voice to take center stage and simply soar. The ballad showcases ethereal keyboards and a hauntingly gorgeous chorus. </p>    <p>Ultimately, Nightwish have made a career out of breaking the rules.&nbsp Their sound could never simply be categorized, and they have managed to continually evolve with each album. With their first U.S. tour with Anette this fall and <em>Dark Passion Play</em> out October 2<sup>nd</sup>, Nightwish are bound to secure their spot at the top.</p>    ', 2004, NULL),
(29, 'Opeth', '                             <strong>Opeth</strong> exist in a genre of one. <br /><br /> The forward-thinking Swedish titans, who seamlessly and fluidly combine metal, rock, prog, folk and free form jazz, continue the time-honored <strong>Opeth</strong> tradition on <em><strong>Watershed</strong>,</em> their second album for <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>. With this, their ninth effort, <strong>Opeth</strong> continue to shake things up, turn the corner and push the limits of their sound. And the results are breathtaking. Ultimately, <em><strong>Watershed</strong> </em>sounds at once completely like and absolutely nothing like previous <strong>Opeth</strong> records.<em><strong> </strong><strong>Watershed</strong> </em>takes all that is <strong>Opeth</strong>, and goes where <strong>Opeth</strong> have never gone before.<br /><br /> Vocalist/guitarist Mikael &Aringkerfeldt says, &quot;This record doesn&rsquo;t sound like a tired band grasping to the last straw. It sounds like a band that is eager to experiment, and that still finds writing music interesting. We&rsquo;re not just putting out a record to put out a record. This is very much an artistic statement.&quot;<br /><strong><br /></strong> <em><strong>Watershed</strong> </em>picks up where 2005&rsquo;s flawless <em><strong>Ghost Reveries</strong> </em>left off, beginning contemplatively before erupting into full-bore chaos. It&rsquo;s an album that combines brute, blunt<br>force with whimsical, melodic beauty. This is something that wasn&rsquo;t done intentionally, &Aringkerfeldt insists. &quot;I try not to be too hung up on having an equal share of screams and singing. I choose the vocal style according to what best fits the song. Some parts have longer instrumental passages as well. Others have quieter vocals. I want what is good for the song, and if that means less death metal vocals or less regular vocals, so be it.&quot; Instead, there are several well-placed screams, which only serve to hammer the points home further. &quot;I&rsquo;m not wasting time or space,&quot; finishes &Aringkerfeldt. &quot;The screams on the album matter, because there are less of them. Instead of using long screams to cover up something, I want to deliver lyrics with full passion, which I never spent time doing before.&quot;<br /><br /> An avid obscure rock fan and record collector who buys records daily, &Aringkerfeldt was inspired and influenced by surprising sources on <em><strong>Watershed</strong>. </em>&quot;I&rsquo;ve been listening to &lsquo60s music and psychedelic music,&quot; he reveals. &quot;Like The Zombies&rsquo; <em>Oddessey &amp Oracle. </em>When I heard it, I knew it was one of the best [albums] I have ever heard in my life and I only heard it last year! I listen to other psychedelic music with sound effects. I also listen to Bill Withers and lots of AC/DC and Scott Walker, who is an American crooner. He&rsquo;s not as slick as Frank Sinatra. He makes very mellow music that is also very dark. His album <em>The Drift </em>is the darkest record I have ever heard in my life, where he is crooning over layers of disharmonic noise that comes from an orchestra. He was beating on a piece of flesh or meat in the studio, and it gave the song this very avant-garde effect. I wanted to do a metal version of that for our record, a record that was impossible to penetrate.&quot;<br /><br /> With <strong><em>Watershed</em></strong>, <strong>Opeth</strong> aren&rsquo;t afraid to think outside of the box, but the album isn&rsquo;t too much of a departure for <strong>Opeth</strong>. The signature <strong>Opeth</strong> sound -&Aringkerfeldt&rsquo;s haunting vocals and distinct riffing- is in tact. It&rsquo;s just tighter. &quot;I think it was Leonard Cohen who said, &lsquoThe longer you are a musician, the more you learn and the better you write.&rsquo; I believe that. I am not one of those guys who can relate to a spontaneous recording by young people full of hormones. I want a delicate, carefully crafted piece of art.&quot;<br /><br /> &Aringkerfeldt continues, saying that <strong><em>Watershed </em></strong>represents the &quot;natural evolution of <strong>Opeth</strong>. Every now and then, we do make a record that is different, but still us. We did it with <em>My Arms, Your Hearse</em>, <em>Blackwater Park</em> and <em>Damnation</em>. Now we are moving forward, and it&rsquo;s exciting.&quot;<br /><br /> <strong>Opeth</strong> continue to stay fresh and to make relevant music deep into their career. The band is bolstered by the addition of some new membership. Drummer Martin Axenrot plays like a battering ram on <em><strong>Watershed</strong>, </em>which also introduces new guitarist Fredrik &Aringkesson, formerly of Arch Enemy, to the fold. &Aringkerfeldt is rejuvenated, rather than stressed by the lineup shift, saying, &quot;I want the band to be bigger than its lineup. I used to be devastated with line up changes. But people change and that just happens, and I refuse to let <strong>Opeth</strong> be a victim of line up changes. I&rsquo;ve always been a nostalgic person and I&rsquo;ve always believed in a stable line-up, but it&rsquo;s impossible to foresee what&rsquo;s going to happen. My dreams of a stable line-up died when our first drummer Anders Nordin left in 1997. I think we moved on to better things since his departure and with that, I learned that as long as all members are pulling towards the same goal and are dedicated people who love to play music, we&rsquo;re set.&quot;<br /><br /> One listen to <em><strong>Watershed</strong> </em>proves the band is positively affected by the internal changes. &Aringkerfeldt claims that &Aringkesson&rsquo;s level of skill helps makes &Aringkerfeldt himself a better player, saying, &quot;I once saw him playing Judas Priest, AC/DC, <strong>King Diamond</strong> and Metallica covers in a pub, and I was blown away. When he was in Arch Enemy, we did tours together and became friends.&quot; <br /><br /> Musically, <em><strong>Watershed</strong> </em>is about having good songs and reaching beyond the obvious influences. Atypical form and structure are the norm in <strong>Opeth</strong>&rsquo;s universe, but at the end of the day, the band understands that everything comes down to having good songs and ideas. &quot;I like adventurous songs with lots of stuff going on. To be a good metal band, it&rsquo;s important, if not absolutely necessary, to look beyond metal for influences. If you don&rsquo;t, you will be a boring, second rate copy of the song you listen to by Iron Maiden,&quot; &Aringkerfeldt]says.<br /><strong><br /></strong> <em><strong>Watershed</strong> </em>was recorded in the band&rsquo;s native Sweden and was produced by &Aringkerfeldt and Jens Bogren. It was the first time &Aringkerfeldt actually enjoyed the recording process, admitting, &quot;We&rsquo;re used to the studio environment, so the recording process is not new or thrilling anymore. The biggest change was letting go of my control need. We were recording in two studios, and I couldn&rsquo;t be at two places at once, so it was stressful, not knowing what was happening at the other studio. But I had to trust the other guys in the band.&quot;<br /><br /> <strong><em>Watershed</em></strong> opens with the quiet, yet powerful &quot;Coil,&quot; which features the bewitching vocals of local folk singer Nathalie Lorichs. &quot;Heir Apparent&quot; is a metallic blockbuster, and the only song with death metal vocals throughout. &quot;The Lotus Eater&quot; features what feels like a first: cleanly sung vocals placed over blast beats! &Aringkerfeldt is particularly proud of the song saying, &quot;It perfectly represents where my musical head is at the moment. It&rsquo;s the most fucked up song on the record, which says a lot about me, but that is what I want <strong>Opeth</strong> to sound like today. It&rsquo;s twisted, complex, and plays through smoothly without interference, despite having a ton of parts.&quot; Smack dab in the middle of the chaos is the gorgeous ballad &quot;Burden&quot; which will remind listeners of bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.  &quot;I wanted to do a big ass mid 70s sounding ballad,&quot; says &Aringkerfeldt. &quot;I was influenced by The Scorpions. I was listening to <em>In Trance, </em>and the song, &quot;Living and Dying.&rsquo; I thought, &lsquoWow, I should do a song like this.&rsquo; It has those mid-70s professional, big solos.&quot; The song &quot;Porcelain Heart&quot; is quite epic, due to the quiet-loud dynamic structure of the song.<br /><strong><br /></strong> <em><strong>Watershed</strong> </em>is the album that will satiate the appetites of <strong>Opeth</strong> diehards, those who have followed the band on their musical journey. It&rsquo;s also the album that will turn new heads, of those who appreciate both the band&rsquo;s and the record&rsquo;s musicality and musicianship. <em><strong>Watershed</strong> </em>proves that <strong>Opeth</strong> are peerless, and truly exist in a genre of one. <br /><br />', 2005, NULL),
(30, 'The Parlor Mob', '                             You&rsquod be forgiven for mistaking <strong>The Parlor Mob</strong> for a much older, more gristled outfit. But along with their technical prowess and world-wearied outlook, the Central Jersey quintet has a significant tell &ndash the careful optimism and sheer energy of the young.  <strong>The Parlor Mob</strong>&rsquos debut album <em>And You Were A Crow</em> bears all the noise and lessons of the past several years for the band. It&rsquos a record constructed out of the most raw materials the grit and transience of rented apartments and borrowed garages, major label hardship, and the fierce brotherhood that has kept the band together through it all. <br /><br /> Finally, however, the hardships the band has suffered appear to be paying off. In addition to the brilliant debut the band has to show for their years together, they&rsquove embarked on their first headlining tour, after consistently selling out rooms in their native New Jersey and New York. &ldquoHeadlining is such a different animal,&rdquo explains bassist Nick Villapiano. &ldquoWe&rsquo;re so used to having thirty or forty minutes to try and grab new fans. Now we have a nice time slot to get thoroughly into our songs.&rdquo But new fans haven&rsquot been difficult for the rock outfit to come by lately -- iTunes just named them Best New Artist of 2008 in the rock genre, and since last year&rsquos Lollapalooza performance, the band has steadily been growing their already significant fanbase. &ldquoIt was amazing,&rdquo says guitarist Paul Ritchie of their performance at last year&rsquos festival. &ldquoIt was the highlight of all of our careers, I&rsquod have to say.&rdquo <br /><br /> Until now that is. Just before embarking on their TK-date tour, the band wrapped the video for first single &ldquoHard Times,&rdquo a chugging, guitar-driven song that rips the album open with lead singer Mark Melicia&rsquos signature moan. More swagger than self-pity, the band decided to showcase what they do best in the video. &ldquo[It]&rsquos performance-based,&rdquo says guitarist Paul Ritchie. &ldquoWe wanted to showcase our strength, which is performing. We wouldn&rsquot want a cheesy storyline to go along with it.&rdquo But the band&rsquos distaste for cheesiness doesn&rsquot mean they&rsquore short on sentiment. The song, a prescient political take on the state affairs, is more swagger than self-pity, and its universality is undeniable. Rarely has a generation&rsquos problems been put so succinctly, and so head-noddingly, into song.<br /><br /> All the setbacks the band sustained to make <em>And You Were A Crow</em> proved necessary to making the album. After an initial major label deal fell through, the band threw themselves into their work. &ldquoWe have a basic gameplan,&rdquo Villapiano continues. &ldquoWe perpetually write. More than anything, it&rsquos a way of therapy, a way to keep us on track.&rdquo Where a lesser band may have retreated to day jobs and eventual nostalgia, <strong>The Parlor Mob</strong> &ndash named for a group of 19th century mercenaries used in New York City riots &ndash channeled their misfortune into their art. <br /><br /> Showcasing the depth of their influences, the band offers up twelve varied tracks with <em>And You Were A Crow</em>, each plumbing one of the many emotions brought on by the events of the band&rsquos five-year history. The epic, emotive &ldquoTide of Tears&rdquo makes use of Melicia&rsquos heart-rending scream amidst dredging guitars and a buoying piano, while elsewhere his smooth croon laces acoustic shuffler &ldquoAngry Young Girl.&rdquo The soulful sway of &ldquoWhen I Was An Orphan,&rdquo says guitarist Dave Rosen, is an expansion of the band&rsquos sound. &ldquoTo me, it&rsquos darker and bigger and heavier. [These songs] don&rsquot sound like a band that&rsquos trying to find itself.&rdquo<br /><br /> Recorded in Echo Mountain Recording Studios in Asheville, North Carolina, the band worked with producer Jacquire King (Kings of Leon, Modest Mouse), who sought out the band&rsquos new record company to work with them. &ldquoWhat sold us on him was his desire to do the majority of the record based on our live performance in the studio. And that&rsquos basically what it is,&rdquo says Ritchie.&nbsp King, infused the album with the camaraderie the band has in abundance. On &ldquoCan&rsquot Keep No Good Boy Down,&rdquo King suggested the band give some indication of the time they were having. &ldquoWe wanted to get a little ambient stuff going on &ndash it&rsquos a redemptive song, so have some chatter and indication that we were having a good time. So we mic&rsquoed the live room where we were recording, brought up some cases of beers and tequila, and recorded the room and talk,&rdquo says Villapiano.<br /><br /> The moods evoked through the symbiosis of music and lyrics make <em>And You Were A Crow</em> a visceral journey, at times deep and dark, and at times thrashing good fun. It&rsquos a time capsule of the lives of five individuals, of place and time. Above all, it&rsquos a testament to the redemptive power of rock and roll for this generation. &ldquoOur story and our outlook are pretty self-explanatory,&rdquo says Villapiano. &ldquoJust a bunch of friends who really love music, really love each other, and are trying our best to share what we&rsquove got with as many people as we can.&rdquo', 2008, NULL),
(31, 'Porcupine Tree', '                             <p>Porcupine Tree is unquestionably one of the most difficult-to-categorize and innovative bands working today.</p><br><p>The band is fronted by Steven Wilson, who also is well-known for his work producing other artists, from Swedish progressive metal group Opeth, to Norwegian chanteuse Anja Garbarek. He also has several other projects, including No-Man, Bass Communion, and Blackfield.</p><br><p>Porcupine Tree was founded as a self-indulgent creative outlet for Wilson, and the first major release was &lsquoOn the Sunday of Life...&rsquo in 1992, an album of psychedelia and studio experiments which bears little relation to the band&rsquo;s current sound. From here, Wilson expanded the sound, creating the progressive rock/ambient trance fusion on the 30-minute long single &ldquoVoyage 34.&rdquo One of the only constants in Porcupine Tree&rsquos music is how it continues to evolve and confront the expectations of the band&rsquo;s fans from album to album.</p><br><p>In late 1993, the solo project became a band, as Colin Edwin (bass), Chris Maitland (drums), and Richard Barbieri (keyboards) were recruited to enable Porcupine Tree to perform live. Richard had previously been a member of one of the most experimental 80&rsquo;s bands, Japan. The first real band album recorded was &lsquoSignify&rsquo in 1996, which was followed by &lsquoStupid Dream&rsquo (1999), a breakthrough album which saw the band move into a more song-orientated direction. &lsquoLightbulb Sun&rsquo continued along that song-oriented tack, but, never content to rest on their laurels, Porcupine Tree changed course again for their next release, shuffling their lineup for the first (and to date, only) time. Chris Maitland departed and was replaced by Gavin Harrison in 2002, as the band signed a new international recording deal with Lava/Atlantic Records.</p><br><p>Since then, three major label album releases -- &lsquoIn Absentia&rsquo and &lsquoDeadwing, and the Grammy-nominated &ldquoFear of a Blank Planet&rsquo -- have augmented the band&rsquo;s renown. Heavier than previous releases, the albums have found favor with older fans and introduced Porcupine Tree to a whole new audience.</p><br><p>In 2006, Porcupine Tree moved to the highly successful independent rock label Roadrunner for Europe. Since releasing Fear of a Blank Planet in 2006, the band have also released a number of titles on its own Transmission label, including the EP Nil Recurring, and the acoustic album We Lost the Skyline.</p><br><p>&lsquoThe Incident&rsquo is Porcupine Tree&rsquos tenth studio album and like &lsquoFear Of A Blank Planet&rsquo &ndash which was an elaborate conceptual piece fuelled by a 21st century cocktail of MTV, sex, prescription drugs, video games, the internet, terminal boredom and subsequent escape &ndash it takes the listener on a thrilling audio journey. In turns haunting, desolate, hypnotic and euphoric, its centre-piece is the title track &ndash a stunning 55-minute musical statement that breaks down into 14 separate and often diverse (though interlinked) vignettes.</p><br><p>The tale begins slowly with &lsquoOccam&rsquos Razor&rsquo, gaining momentum and intensity with &lsquoThe Blind House,&rsquo &lsquoDrawing The Line&rsquo, and &lsquoThe Incident&rsquo itself, though the group&rsquos masterful manipulation of sounds and textures is never overlooked. The mellowness of &lsquoThe Yellow Windows Of The Evening Train,&rsquo for instance, is accompanied by the gentle crackle of a needle on vinyl &ndash for all his skill as a producer and remixer, Wilson is a staunch supporter of the &lsquoold&rsquo ways of listening to music. Incorporating both of these styles, &lsquoOctane Twisted&rsquo somehow batters and seduces simultaneously, while &lsquoI Drive The Hearse,&rsquo further sweetened by an uplifting guitar climax, is an intoxicating slice of melancholy with which to book-end the record&rsquos 14-piece song cycle.</p><br><p>The seeds of the idea that led to &lsquoThe Incident&rsquo came to Steven Wilson as he became caught up in a motorway traffic jam whilst driving past a road accident.</p><br><p>&ldquoThere was a sign saying &lsquoPOLICE &ndash INCIDENT&rsquo and everyone was slowing down to rubber neck what had happened,&rdquo he recalls. &ldquoAfterwards, it struck me that &lsquoincident&rsquo is a very detached word for something so destructive and traumatic for the people involved. And then I had the sensation that the spirit of someone that had died in the car accident entered into my car and was sitting next to me.</p><br><p>&ldquoThe irony of such a cold expression for such seismic events appealed to me, and I began to pick out other &lsquoincidents&rsquo reported in the media and news,&rdquo continues Wilson. &ldquoI wrote about the evacuation of teenage girls from a religious cult in Texas, a family terrorizing its neighbours, a body found floating in a river by some people on a fishing trip, and more. Each song was written in the first person and tried to humanize the detached media reportage.&rdquo</p><br><p>Additionally, Wilson delved back into incidents in his own life that had profound affected him, including a lost childhood friendship, a s&eacuteance, his first love, and the day that he decided to give up secure employment to follow his dream of making music. The album&rsquos epic song, an 11-minute Pink Floyd-flavoured masterpiece called &lsquoTime Flies&rsquo, for instance, begins with the line: &ldquoI was born in 1967.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquo1967 was possibly the most significant year in the history of rock music &lsquoSergeant Pepper&rsquo by the Beatles and the first albums by Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and The Doors were all released that year,&rdquo says Steven. &ldquoI found myself wondering whether those facts were significant&hellip maybe it&rsquos why I ended up becoming a musician?&rdquo</p><br><p>&lsquoThe Incident&rsquo poses a lot of important questions and will give the listener plenty of food for thought. As ever, though, Wilson is loath to provide what he thinks the answers might be. &ldquoOne of the beauties of music &ndash one of the reasons it&rsquos still the greatest art-form, even over cinema &ndash is that it demands so much of the person that experiences it, as well as those that create it.&rdquo</p><br><p>&lsquoThe Incident&rsquo is certainly not the kind of album that will be fully absorbed in a single sitting. Indeed, repeated listenings reveal all sorts of hidden detail. &ldquoIt&rsquos definitely not an album that should inspire a passive response,&rdquo proclaims Wilson.</p><br><p>Pushed for a more succinct description he calls &lsquoThe Incident&rsquo: &ldquoA slightly surreal song cycle about beginnings and endings and the sense that &lsquoafter this, things will never be the same again&rsquo.&rdquo</p><br><p>Coming to the recording sessions following his first ever solo album, November 2008&rsquos &lsquoInsurgentes,&rsquo Wilson admits that the experience of having worked alone affected the direction of &lsquoThe Incident.&rsquo &ldquoPossibly because of having done that, this record is darker, more expansive, and more experimental,&rdquo he theorizes. &ldquoBut when I write for Porcupine Tree, I know the sound I&rsquom after.&rdquo</p><br><p>While<strong> </strong>&lsquoFear Of A Blank Planet&rsquo featured contributions from three special guests &ndash Alex Lifeson of Rush, King Crimson&rsquos Robert Fripp and the band&rsquos live guitarist John Wesley &ndash and &lsquoInsurgentes&rsquo was also executed with considerable outside help, &lsquoThe Incident&rsquo is slightly unusual for being completely self-contained. Like its predecessor, however, it was self-produced by all four group members.</p><br><p>&lsquoThe Incident&rsquo is completed by four standalone compositions &ndash &lsquoFlicker&rsquo, &lsquoBonnie The Cat&rsquo, &lsquoBlack Dahlia&rsquo and &lsquoRemember Me Love&rsquo &ndash all housed on a separate CD to stress their independence from the record&rsquos main 14-part suite.</p><br><p>As with &lsquoFear Of A Blank Planet&rsquo, the Wilson-helmed 5.1 mix of which was nominated in the Best Surround Album Award at the 2007 Grammies (eventually losing out to The Beatles&rsquo &lsquoLove&rsquo), Porcupine Tree will be performing &lsquoThe Incident&rsquo in its entirety during the first shows of its next world tour.</p><br><p>Porcupine Tree is Steven Wilson, Colin Edwin, Richard Barbieri, and Gavin Harrison.</p>', 2009, NULL);

Popular bands break up, then years later they reunite and sadly wind up sounding little like the turbo-fueled entities they once were when they started. Then there are the rare exceptions &ndash like <strong>Ratt</strong>.</p><br><p>As the story goes, Ratt helped pioneer Hollywood&rsquos legendary Sunset Strip sound and scene.&nbsp The band has returned sounding fired up and better than ever. Ratt&rsquos first studio album in 11 years, <strong><em>Infestation</em></strong>, is a return to their heavy, riff driven roots.&nbsp The band has reinvented their sound by rediscovering their strengths, shuttling listeners to a time when metal ruled the earth and real musicians wore eyeliner like a badge of honor.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe wanted this to be like something that we would have written right after [1984&rsquos] <em>Out of the Cellar</em>, says vocalist <strong>Stephen Pearcy</strong>. &ldquoWe definitely went back to basics with the mindset of a band with a lot of excitement and some great songs to get out.&rdquo</p><br><p>Right out of the box, <em>Infestation</em> ignites like gasoline to an open flame, bursting with an energy and attitude absent from metal for years, unheard, perhaps, since before the dawn of DVDs, grunge and Facebook. Album opener &ldquoEat Me Up Alive&rdquo slaps you in the face with attitude and a timeless riff that has been a staple in Ratt&rsquos music and has set them apart from the pack.&nbsp From the strip pole gyrations of &ldquoLook Out Below&rdquo to the keg party anthem &ldquoTake a Big Bite,&rdquo <em>Infestation</em> rages with a life and energy that Ratt is famous for.</p><br><p>Yet <em>Infestation</em> is more than a party album. While the music is a glorious celebration throughout, some of the lyrics are serious and sobering, weighing the benefits of monogamy versus the thrill of rampant hedonism without being preachy or judgmental. On &ldquoTake Me Home,&rdquo Pearcy declares, &ldquoI&rsquoll tell you a little secret that you need to know/ you&rsquore always in my heart, always in my soul.&rdquo Then, in &ldquoGarden of Eden,&rdquo his alter ego brags: &ldquoI got a bad reputation and you knew it so well/ yeah, I&rsquoll give you what you need/I&rsquom gonna take you to hell.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoI was not in that good of a place emotionally when we were writing this record,&rdquo admits Pearcy. &ldquoSure there are sexual innuendos and party stuff, but there are also songs that deal with some very real issues. The lyrics meant so much to me that every morning for weeks prior to recording, I would wake up and rewrite. It was a strange process for me, but it worked.&rdquo</p><br><p>Ratt started writing <em>Infestation</em> in January 2009, and by April they had 20 new songs, which they refined with producer <strong>Michael &ldquoElvis&rdquo Baskette</strong> (Chevelle, Alter Bridge). But before they could even start the shiny metal wheels rolling, they had to secure their lineup and repair years of enmity that developed when Pearcy abruptly quit for personal reasons in 1999. It was a rough era for Ratt. Pearcy was replaced by vocalist Jizzy Pearl and John Corabi took the second guitar slot, replacing original axeman Robbin Crosby.<em> </em></p><br><p>Founding drummer<strong> Bobby Blotzer</strong> and bassist <strong>Robbie Crane</strong>, who has been a mainstay and driving force in the band since 1996, remained constant, though while Ratt worked hard in the early &lsquo90s, they purposely stayed on the road and out of the studio.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe decided not to pursue recording a Ratt record when Stephen was out of the band<em>,&rdquo </em>says guitarist <strong>Warren DeMartini</strong>. &ldquoWe definitely wanted to retain that same lineup for a long time, but life comes along and changes those plans. Stephen quit the band, and we didn&rsquot want that to mean the end of Ratt.&rdquo</p><br><p>After some serious discussions, Pearcy rejoined and in 2007, DeMartini, Pearcy, Blotzer and Crane took the stage together for the first time in eight years, playing over 50 dates<em>,</em> and releasing the best of CD <em>Tell the World: The Very Best of Ratt</em>. Also, they released their first ever DVD <em>RATT Videos from the Cellar: The Atlantic Years</em>. The shows were a telling precursor of what was to come.</p><br><p>&ldquoThat <em>tour</em> was really exciting and refreshing because the sound was back, and even better,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoStephen had grown, we had grown, and with those pieces restored, we knew we could get back to writing.&rdquo</p><br><p>With a bunch of shows under their belts, Ratt were eager to get back into the cellar and write some new songs, but they wanted to add to their lineup. DeMartini suggested ex-Quiet Riot guitarist <strong>Carlos Cavazo</strong> to round out the lineup. Cavazo, a well known, accomplished lead player gives Ratt the twin-guitar attack and credibility they had in the early days with Crosby.</p><br><p>&ldquoI thought of bringing in Carlos a couple years before it actually happened,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoAt the time, we thought we were going to be replacing John because of conflicting schedules and I started thinking it would be cool to have Carlos. So when the time was right, he was the first person I called.&rdquo</p><br><p>For Cavazo, who was between projects the offer came at a perfect time. And since he already knew the guys in Ratt from the early days, he felt comfortable with the personalities of the players.</p><br><p>&ldquoIt worked out great for me and felt very natural,&rdquo Cavazo says. &ldquoIt&rsquos funny because I was just hanging out in my house one day and I missed a call. So I checked my voice mail and noticed it was Warren. The first thing I&rsquom thinking is, &lsquoEither there&rsquos a big party he&rsquos going to invite me to somewhere, or they&rsquore looking for a new guitar player.&rsquo Obviously, it was the latter.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoIt&rsquos great to be able to do the more exotic double lead stuff that I<em> </em>did back in the day with Robbin,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoI wanted someone I could collaborate with and someone who could sing well, so Carlos worked out on all levels.&rdquo</p><br><p>Ratt flew to a remote area of Virginia Beach in spring 2009 to work on new songs. They stayed in a four bedroom house there and wrote on their own schedule, banging out riff after riff and molding them into tunes quickly and with great enthusiasm.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe wanted go off the beaten path on this one and set up somewhere we could eat, sleep and create the album in the same place,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoIt was great fun we had the camaraderie of a road trip together with the environment to really stay focused.&rdquo</p><br><p>While DeMartini, Cavazo, Crane and drummer Bobby Blotzer finessed the music, Pearcy stayed in his room and worked on his lyrics<em>. </em></p><br><p>&ldquoIt was exciting because none of us knew how the melody and the lyrics would work with the songs until Stephen finally brought us his part,&rdquo Blotzer says. &ldquoThe outcome was surprising in a good way.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoIt was great that we had those writing sessions together,&rdquo Pearcy adds. &ldquoSome of my parts were written right then and there in the studio in preproduction. That hadn&rsquot happened since &lsquo83 and &lsquo84. One of these songs, &ldquoGarden of Eden,&rdquo was just a riff idea, but then in preproduction Warren just started playing this riff and I went, &lsquoWhat is that? I like it. Keep that. Work on that.&rsquo And we worked it out that day.&rdquo</p><br><p>As Ratt worked out their ideas in preproduction, Baskette recorded their jam session on two-inch analog tape, much of the same equipment the band had used in the &lsquo80s. In addition, he employed numerous modern studio techniques to capture the sound the band was after. Baskette also helped Ratt hone good ideas into great songs and gave the musicians the liberty to let fly with whatever creative ideas they had.</p><br><p>&ldquoI was very focused on playing harder and more outside the constraints that I had on previous Ratt records,&rdquo Blotzer says. &ldquoAnd I was really given the key to do that from the band and from Elvis.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoIt was great for Carlos and me as well because Elvis was a guitarist in a band before he was a producer, and he&rsquos real into tones,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoHe was coming from the same place guitar-wise as us<em>,</em> which isn&rsquot always the case.&rdquo</p><br><p>The cumulative playing, recording and circumstantial synergy shines throughout <em>Infestation</em>. The first single &ldquoBest of Me&rdquo is a feast of foot-to-the floor dynamics that features gritty vocals that uncurl like a coiled snake into a glorious chorus, and guitar lines as memorable as a dirty limerick. &ldquoGarden of Eden&rdquo builds from a bluesy intro into a pounding gallop, and shifts into a surging stop-start sky-puncher at the midpoint. But maybe it&rsquos a line in the mid-paced &ldquoAs Good as it Gets&rdquo that most accurately sums up the approach, attitude and conviction of <em>Infestation</em>: &ldquoYou get just what you came for.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoOur music is like it was in the beginning it means everything to us,&rdquo Pearcy says. &ldquoAnd here we are 25 years later, keeping Ratt N&rsquo Roll alive.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoWhen we play concerts now, there&rsquos a new generation.&nbsp We&rsquore seeing kids of people who grew up with us, but the reaction is the same,&rdquo adds DeMartini. &ldquoIt doesn&rsquot seem to matter where we are in the world.&rdquo &nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p>', 2010, NULL),
(36, 'ROADRUNNER UNITED THE CONCERT', '                             It was a &quot;You had to be there&quot; event. A concert during which 39 musicians, representing 25 different Roadrunner bands, performing 25 songs from 19 different bands&rsquo repertoire. This unique and unprecedented aggregation of musicians was no jam session. Each song was studiously rehearsed and arranged and came together in exuberant perfection. By the time everything was said and done, it was one helluva a party. <br /><br />Now it&rsquo;s time for the DVD that captured it all. <br /><br />Roadrunner Records&rsquo; 25th anniversary celebration, held on Thursday, December 15, 2005 at New York City&rsquo;s Nokia Theater, was a night to remember. For those who experienced the event first hand, it was a once-in-a-lifetime party and concert where artists that spanned the label&rsquo;s history, as well as artist and industry friends, converged to toast all things Roadrunner. The party was held in conjunction with the landmark <strong><em>Roadrunner United The All-Star Sessions</em></strong> album, released two months prior. <br /><br />Almost three years to the day later, Roadrunner is releasing a DVD that chronicles an evening of raised metal horns, dubbed <strong><em>Roadrunner United The Concert</em></strong>, a two-disc set that captures the festive intensity of the night. The concert enjoyed a cult, &quot;You had to be there!&quot; status in the metal and hard rock scenes and now Roadrunner is giving the label&rsquo;s diehard followers a chance to witness the event themselves.<br /><br />Throughout its rich and impressive history, Roadrunner Records has been destined for greatness, evolving from a small Dutch licensing label into one of the most innovative record labels in the world. Fiercely independent since its start, Roadrunner has achieved something that many labels seek and never attain, let alone maintain for a quarter-century: brand recognition. The Roadrunner logo has come to mean two things to millions of fans around the world: a high standard of quality in musicianship and presentation and an unwavering commitment to the best, most unique and intense in the hard rock and heavy metal genres. <br /><br />In 2005, in typical Roadrunner fashion, the label devised a brilliantly inventive way to celebrate its milestone 25th anniversary. Paying homage to its past, giving a nod to its future and framing both in the most creative terms possible, Roadrunner released an album of original new heavy music, played by some of the genre&rsquo;s best and most highly-regarded practitioners. <br /><br />&ldquoRoadrunner&rsquo;s owner, Cees Wessels, asked me to come up with an idea to celebrate Roadrunner&rsquo;s 25th anniversary,&rdquo recalls A&ampR visionary Monte Conner. &ldquoI knew that for it to be really special, we would need to come up with a record that involved many musicians, one that was truly a collaboration on a grand scale, an album that would cover the entire history of Roadrunner and feature some of our most legendary artists from the past, right up to and including musicians from our newest signings.&rdquo <br /><br />The idea was mathematical from the get-go and was formulated to create four &ldquoteams&rdquo -- each headed by a &ldquoteam captain.&rdquo Each team would consist of a core of musicians who would lay down basic tracks for four original songs written by the team captain. Each song would use a different vocalist, and no player could appear on a tune by another team. The four captains -- <strong>Slipknot</strong> drummer Joey Jordison, <strong>Machine Head</strong> frontman Robb Flynn, former<strong> Fear Factory</strong> guitarist Dino Cazares and <strong>Trivium</strong> vocalist Matthew K. Heafy &ndash assembled their songs and their musicians for an album that was released in October 2005. An astounding total of 56 musicians from 44 different bands were assembled in an amazing organizational feat and a sign of the respect and that each player had for each other and the label itself. <br /><br />Furthermore, those same artists, and then some, continued to pay their respects to Roadrunner for the <strong>Roadrunner United</strong> concert! Most of the musicians that performed on the album trekked to NYC for the party and performance. Many artists from Roadrunner&rsquo;s history who weren&rsquo;t even on the <strong><em>Roadrunner United The All-Star Sessions</em></strong> album were in attendance. Musicians who were friends of the label also agreed to lend their talents to the performance. The core &quot;house&quot; band consisted of <strong>Slipknot&rsquo;s </strong>Joey Jordison and Paul Gray, <strong>Machine Head&rsquo;s</strong> Adam Duce, <strong>Sepultura&rsquo;s</strong> Andreas Kisser, <strong>Soulfly&rsquo;s</strong> and <strong>Stone Sour&rsquo;s</strong> Roy Mayorga, <strong>Fear Factory&rsquo;s</strong> Dino Cazares, who throughout the evening,  were joined by a jaw-dropping, rotating cast of performers. <br /><br />Some of the evening&rsquo;s highlights included <strong>Slipknot&rsquo;s</strong> Corey Taylor singing while perched atop the shoulders of  <strong>Killswitch Engage&rsquo;s</strong> Howard Jones. Former <strong>Killswitch Engage</strong> vocalist Jesse Leach reunited with his former band for a rendition of &quot;My Last Serenade.&quot; Other gems included an animated performance by <strong>Shadows Fall&rsquo;s</strong> Brian Fair, a &quot;F** Monte Conner&quot; chant, Taylor performing &quot;Bother&quot; with <strong>Life of Agony&rsquo;s</strong> Keith Caputo, and Taylor watching Flynn perform one of <strong>Slipknot&rsquo;s</strong> songs. <br /><br />The double-disc set features the concert footage as well as a second disc, a 75-minute documentary, complete with interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, making the festivities that much more intimate for the viewer.<br /><br />Among the performers were: Steve Asheim, Matt Baumbach, Corey Beaulieu, Glenn Benton, Rob Caggiano, Keith Caputo, Dino Cazares, Mike D&rsquo;Antonio, Phil Demmel, Adam Duce, Brian Fair, Robb Flynn, Justin Foley, Paul Gray, Billy Graziadei, Paolo Gregoletto, Matthew K. Heafy, Andols Herrick, Scott Ian, Jamey Jasta, Howard Jones, Joey Jordison, Andreas, Kisser, Jesse Leach, Logan Mader, Roy Mayorga, James Murphy, Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, Nadja Puelen, Evan Seinfeld, Acey Slade, Travis Smith, Joel Stroetzel, Corey Taylor, Ville Valo, Tommy Vext, Jeff Waters, Jordan Whelan and Tim Williams.<br /> <br />Indeed, heavy metal history was made on December 15, 2005. Here&rsquo;s to another 25 years of Roadrunner Records exerting its dominance in the headbanging, hard rocking sphere.', 2005, NULL),
(37, 'Rob Zombie', '                             <p>A music artist and auteur filmmaker with shrewd insight and unlimited vision, <strong>Rob Zombie</strong> has continuously challenged audiences as he stretches the boundaries of film, music and publishing. He&rsquos not happy merely sporting a single creative hat instead, he submerges himself fully in each artistic endeavor, rolling up his sleeves and immersing his hands completely in each project. That&rsquos the long and short of the artist known as Rob Zombie.</p><br><p>But perhaps the arena in which Rob Zombie is best known and most celebrated for is his music. He is a 7 time Grammy-nominated recording artist, having sold over fifteen million albums worldwide to date. Late 2009 brings Zombie to a new home at <strong>Loud&ampProud/Roadrunner Records</strong>, with a new album, the long awaited <strong><em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2</em></strong>, due out February 2, 2010.</p><br><p>The demons were let loose on <em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2,</em> which comes a dozen years after its predecessor, <em>Hellbilly Deluxe, </em>the album that established Zombie as a solo artist in his own right following the demise of White Zombie. That album also yielded a string of successful radio singles, namely &ldquoDragula&rdquo and &ldquoLiving Dead Girl,&rdquo both of which dominated the airwaves in 1998 and 1999, closing out the decade, Zombie style.</p><br><p>Well, it&rsquos a new decade (and a new millennium, not to mention) and <em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2 </em>picks up where its predecessor left off. Even though there were two studio albums -2001&rsquos <em>The Sinister Urge</em> and 2006&rsquos <em>Educated </em>Horses&mdashin between the <em>Hellbilly </em>bookends, only an artist of Zombie&rsquos caliber, however, can make the jump so seamlessly with <em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2, </em>which features the infectious single, <strong>&ldquoSick Bubblegum,&rdquo</strong> which sounds like it was written during the original&rsquos sessions, but remains modern, relevant and forward-thinking. <strong>&ldquoWhat?&rdquo</strong> is a catchy, distorted track that screams of signature Zombie, the one his throng of fans knows and loves. <strong>&ldquoWerewolf, Baby!&rdquo</strong> is another sick &lsquon twisted rock &lsquon roll anthem, while other electric romps like <strong>&ldquoJesus Frankenstein&rdquo</strong> and the thunderous <strong>&ldquoMars Needs Women&rdquo</strong>&nbsp are vintage Zombie featuring ass-moving grooves piled on&nbsp a storm of chunky riffs. <em>Hellbilly Deluxe</em> 2 is Rob Zombie in 2010: leaner and meaner, with the same snarl and appreciation for all things dark and a little bit dastardly. It&rsquos no easy feat to record a companion-style follow-up 10 years later, but Rob Zombie makes it look and sound easy. <strong></strong></p><br><p>&ldquoThis was one of the least stressful records I&rsquove ever made. The songs fell together in record time. &rdquo says Zombie, &ldquoFor some reason the best songs always come easy.&rdquo</p><br><p>Not content to merely arrest the world with his delightfully nefarious tunes, Rob Zombie directed the second edition of the Halloween franchise,<em> Halloween 2</em> for Dimension Films, which came out in August 2009. It was his fifth time writing and directing a feature film. Zombie had also interpreted John Carpenter&rsquos original cult horror film <em>Halloween </em>in 2007 that film premiered &nbspat number one at the box office, &nbspbreaking all Labor Day Weekend 2007 records and grossing an estimated 80 million dollars worldwide. His efforts on rebooting and reinventing this beloved franchise earned him two nominations from Spike TV&rsquos Scream Awards, for Best Director and Best Remake he picked up the award for the latter. &nbspHis previous films include 2004&rsquos <em>House of 1000 Corpses </em>and 2005&rsquos critically acclaimed <em>The Devil&rsquos Rejects </em>also a Spike Award winner<em>. </em>Zombie wrapped production on his animated, R-rated feature, <em>The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, </em>which is now available on DVD.</p><br><p>For the past two decades Zombie has directed dozens of videos, having lensed tracks for fellow metal superstar Ozzy Osbourne, among others. He contributes material to soundtracks and isn&rsquot afraid to push boundaries and ignore the parameters when it comes to the both the audio and visual mediums. He won the 1995 MTV Music Video Award for White Zombie&rsquos &lsquoMore Human Than Human,&rsquo making history by becoming the first self-directed artist to pick up the award.</p><br><p>In fall 2009, Zombie kicked off the &lsquoHellbilly Deluxe 2 Tour,&rdquo where he was accompanied by his longtime bandmates: guitarist John 5, bassist Piggy D and drummer Tommy Clufetos.&nbsp &ldquoI am bouncing off the walls like a mental patient,&rdquo Zombie said about the tour. &ldquoThat tells me it&rsquos time to take it to the stage and let the demons loose.&rdquo&nbsp Zombie will continue to tour following the album&rsquos release.</p><br><p>When it comes to any artistic feat or endeavor, leave it to Rob Zombie to accomplish what appears on paper to be nearly impossible. Armed with <em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2, </em>this artist is once again about to swoop down and capture the hearts of hard rockers the world over.</p>', 2010, NULL),

(42, 'Slipknot', '                             <strong>Slipknot</strong> singer Corey Taylor knew his band was destined for greatness. He also knew that it wouldn&rsquo;t come easy.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;When we were starting out, we had all these strikes against us,&quot; he says. &quot;We were from Iowa, there were nine of us, we wore masks, we wore coveralls, we played metal. Hard metal.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;It was tough getting people to come out to Des Moines,&quot; adds bassist Paul Gray. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know why, it&rsquo;s a pretty cool place. But A&ampR dudes -- jaded folks from Los Angeles or New York -- it&rsquo;s hard to get them to come to Iowa.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;And then there were all the haters,&quot; says Taylor.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Ah, the haters. The people who liked nothing more than to give the band flack for its look, for substituting numbers for names, for putting on a show full of over-the-top chaos and unmitigated mayhem. Some of the comments came from the usual assortment of web sites and so-called music critics. But, surprisingly, &quot;we also took a lot of shit from other bands,&quot; says guitarist James Root. &quot;When we hit the road with Ozzfest in 1999, I heard a lot of condescending remarks from other musicians. They were saying, &rsquo;Slipknot won&rsquo;t sell enough records, they won&rsquo;t survive, they&rsquo;ve got too many people, nobody&rsquo;s gonna get it, they&rsquo;re all about image.&rsquo; &quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;The joke&rsquo;s on them,&quot; says Taylor with wicked glee. &quot;Our music stood up. We&rsquo;re much more popular now and it wasn&rsquo;t because of our image. It was the music.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Now, most of the bands who turned slagging <strong>Slipknot</strong> into an extreme sport have fallen off the face of the earth. The &rsquo;Knot, on the other hand, have spent nearly a decade cementing their place as one of hard rock&rsquos most extreme acts. They&rsquo;ve dropped three albums and two DVDs, all of which went Platinum or better. They&rsquo;ve sold out festivals and tours around the globe. And they are preparing to release their fourth record, All Hope Is Gone. <br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br /><strong>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Slipknot</strong> -- which features DJ Sid Wilson (0), drummer Joey Jordison (1), Gray (2), percussionist Chris Fehn (3) Root (4), sampler Craig Jones - 133 (5), percussionist M. Shawn Crahan - Clown (6), guitarist Mick Thomson (7) and Taylor (8), -- is still heavy, still enamored of great, big walls of deeply textured layers of sound. But this time, they&rsquo;ve approached their music with an eye towards stylistic expression that completely invalidates any and all comments about heavy metal clich&eacutes. Moreover, they&rsquo;ve continued the exploration of melody that began on their first record. &nbsp<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Songs like &quot;Sulfur&quot; and &quot;Psychosocial&quot; deliver crushing verses and bridges, but then explode into soaring choruses that provide a powerful showcase for Taylor&rsquo;s voice. The song &quot;Vendetta&quot; features a sleazy, rough-and-tumble kind of swagger, but still delivers Slipknot&rsquo;s trademark balls-out fury. And &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; just spews raw anger, aggression, hate and foulness that serves as a reminder to anyone still stupid enough to harbor doubts that Slipknot are experts at delivering pure, heavy-metal punishment.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;It&rsquo;s our fourth album, and we wanted to do something different,&quot; says Gray. &quot;You can&rsquo;t put out the same record over and over again. At the same time, you can definitely still tell that this is <strong>Slipknot</strong>.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;I&rsquo;m looking forward to the expressions on people&rsquo;s faces when they hear the new record,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;There&rsquo;s very, very heavy stuff on this album, and it&rsquo;s gonna blow people&rsquo;s minds. But I&rsquo;m also excited for them to see the stuff that&rsquo;s different on this album, the more experimental music. No one&rsquo;s going to expect it.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Much of the album&rsquo;s diversity comes from the band&rsquo;s new approach to writing and recording. Over the years, most of the members have worked on various side projects, none of which sound remotely like Slipknot. It&rsquo;s no surprise to find out that these efforts influenced the writing process. Perhaps even more importantly, All Hope Is Gone was the first album on which contributions came from nearly all the band members, with each person bringing his own unique voice to the mix.&nbsp The band co-produced the album with Dave Fortman.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;I think everyone just went in with an open mind. We would always listen to everyone&rsquo;s ideas, and if they worked, they worked, if they didn&rsquo;t, they didn&rsquo;t,&quot; explains Gray. &quot;This time, we really tried to build off the ideas, really tried to work on them.&nbsp I think it helped that so many of us were able to spend time doing our own thing, too.&nbsp Just writing with different people really makes a difference in how you think about music. When we finally came together, we were able to bring that to the mix.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br /><strong>Slipknot</strong> also made the executive decision to abandon Los Angeles, where they had recorded previous records. Instead, they came back home and set up camp in <em><strong>Iowa</strong></em>. The differences were immediately apparent.<br /><br />&ldquoIt gave us more time and energy to experiment in the studio.&nbsp&nbsp I was able to come up with more guitar sounds than ever,&rdquo says Root.<br /><br />While the heart of <strong>Slipknot</strong> remains its music, its soul is planted firmly on stage. Today, <strong>Slipknot</strong> are playing in sold-out arenas, but the band developed their talents by slogging it out in the Midwest, playing any show they could find. These were frequently one-off shows the band would travel from their hometown of Des Moines to places like Omaha&nbsp and Chicago. &quot;There were never any actual tours in those days,&quot; says Thomson. &quot;Our shows were like sporting events: We&rsquod put everything into them and then afterwards, we&rsquo;d be fucking exhausted. We weren&rsquo;t going to pile into a van -- all nine of us -- and then drive all night to the next show. We&rsquo;d have fallen asleep at the wheel and died.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Those early shows were rough, but I loved the small stage,&quot; says Gray. &quot;There was something intimate about it.&nbsp It was like an old-school punk show, which is what I grew up with.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;I don&rsquo;t miss that shit at all,&quot; disagrees Thomson. &quot;It was 8,000 degrees, you&rsquo;re bumping into people, you&rsquo;re tripping over equipment. Those small stages have low ceilings, so the heat&rsquo;s trapped real low -- right at your head. Those shows are about survival, not about playing.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />As difficult as those early shows were for the band, they were just as challenging for whoever might be standing in the front row. &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Shawn used to bring chop saws on stage to grind pipes for sparks,&quot; remembers Thomson. &quot;Once, a chunk broke off and sent a kid to the hospital.&nbsp But people who got hurt at our shows were cool about it -- we&rsquo;d follow them to the hospital and sign some shirts and shit. It was like, you know, no harm, no foul.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Everyone tried to control us, though,&quot; says Taylor.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Yeah, those fuckers,&quot; says Thomson. &quot;We&rsquo;d be on tour and fire marshals would show up with camcorders and accuse us of all kinds of crazy bullshit. They&rsquo;d say, &rsquo;We heard you set yourselves on fire.&rsquo; <br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Well&hellip okay, we&rsquo;d done that!&quot; Thomson continues, laughing. &quot;Sid and Clown would spray each other with lighter fluid and then they&rsquo;d pull out lighters. That got us in trouble. One promoter would call the next -- they&rsquo;d warn each other and they&rsquo;d hit us with &rsquo;do not&rsquo; lists. We were castrated.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Surviving for 10 years is an accomplishment for any band. With <strong>Slipknot</strong>, it feels like some sort of miracle. Personalities frequently collide, side-projects abound, and on-stage fights are common. And yet, year after year, album after album, all nine men keep coming back for more. &quot;We&rsquo;re banded together in hate,&quot; says Jordison. &quot;Sometimes we hate each other, sometimes we hate the world, sometimes we just hate our own lives. But when we get together, something monstrous happens and we pull this amazing sound out of all that energy.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Plus,&quot; he adds, &quot;we believe in world domination, and this is the band that&rsquo;s gonna get us there.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;You know, we went from being some local band in a basement to selling millions of records,&quot; says Gray. &quot;It&rsquo;s going to be a decade since the first album came out. I&rsquo;m so happy and amazed and proud and thankful for where this band has gone. I&rsquo;ve gotten to see the world -- and I get paid for it! I&rsquo;d have done it for free.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Chris Fehn agrees. &quot;I think the best part about being in this band has been getting exposure to the rest of the world. You realize that everything in the world is the same -- people feel the same, they have the same desires, hopes, fears. Being worldly is a gift that I don&rsquo;t ever want to give back. It changes your life -- especially when you&rsquo;re from a small town in Iowa.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;I always knew we&rsquo;d go far. I just knew it,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;There was no way this band was going to fail. But I never knew we&rsquo;d reach the heights we&rsquo;ve come to. We&rsquo;ve traveled the world so many times all the different countries are like our second homes. To this day, it still blows me away that we took this crazy idea and made it a global sensation.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><strong><em>All Hope Is Gone</em></strong> will be released on Roadrunner Records on August 26th.<br />', 1999, NULL),

Following the warpath left by 2008&rsquo;s critically acclaimed <em>Conquer</em>, <em>Omen</em> is a sign of Soulfly becoming an even fiercer, fierier and more furious metallic monster, seven albums into their storied career. Various Soulfly traditions remain upheld over the course of the album&rsquo;s 11 tracks. Bobby Burns&rsquo; bass rumbles and roars on teeth-gnashing opener &quot;Bloodbath and Beyond,&quot; as Joe Nunez commences pure percussive pummeling. Marc Rizzo tears through throat-slitting leads, while still making room to groove on the likes of &quot;Lethal Injection.&quot; Max&rsquo;s unmistakable vocals and riffs work in tandem for the ultimate aural assault.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Max and Co. simply don&rsquo;t stop. Soulfly&rsquo;s Gold-certified, self-titled debut, has become a genre classic since its 1998 release. Six records and countless sold out shows across the world have paved the path for <em>Omen</em>. For Max, his latest Soulfly offering is the culmination of over a decade of growth. He explains, &quot;We entered a heavier and more aggressive phase with <em>Dark Ages</em> and <em>Conquer</em>. <em>Omen</em> is really violent in terms of the lyrics and the music. I think this record brings fans closer to Soulfly than ever before. It&rsquo;s got every element that people loved from the last two albums. It&rsquo;s all there, but it goes beyond that. People that liked <em>Conquer</em> are going to love <em>Omen</em> because there are a couple more surprises.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Some of those surprises come in the form of very special guest appearances. In the past, Max has collaborated with everyone from Slipknot&rsquo;s Corey Taylor and Slayer&rsquo;s Tom Araya to Deftones&rsquo; Chino Moreno and Sean Lennon. He&rsquo;s opted for two more genre luminaries this time around. On &quot;Rise of the Fallen,&quot; Max trades schizophrenic vocal tirades with Dillinger Escape Plan&rsquo;s Greg Puciato.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&quot;I met Greg during a Deftones show in LA,&quot; says Max. &quot;I told him that he should drop by the studio if he wanted to sing something. He loved the song from the beginning, but he told me he wanted to make it epic. Greg did the chaotic, high-pitched, Dillinger Escape Plan vocals, but he also did some melodic vocals at the end that gave the track another dimension. The song blows me away, and it continues the tradition of Soulfly collaborations.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Meanwhile, for &quot;Lethal Injection,&quot; Max enlisted the help of an old friend, Prong&rsquo;s Tommy Victor. Max said, &quot;Tommy did a killer job on the vocals. I&rsquo;ve loved Prong since the early days. Prong was part of a Pantera tour Sepultura did. It&rsquo;s really cool that he&rsquo;s on this record now.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Most bands slow down with age&mdashnot Soulfly. Seven records in and they still create chaos better than anyone in this century. &quot;Violence runs on all the tracks,&quot; offers Max. &quot;Murder is this record&rsquo;s state of mind&mdashfrom &rsquo;Bloodbath and Beyond&rsquo; to &rsquo;Jeffrey Dahmer.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a really violent album. I always wanted to write a song about a serial killer. This was my chance. &rsquo;Jeffrey Dahmer&rsquo; has such a catchy chorus mentioning his name, and I can hear people singing that. <em>Omen</em> mostly came out of every day experience though. <em>Omen</em> is a mysterious name, and it can relate to a lot of different things. From the whole time we were in the studio, I knew the album was going to be called <em>Omen</em>.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Max recorded with producer Logan Mader [Cavalera Conspiracy, Gojira, Devildriver] at Edge of the Earth Studios in Hollywood. He entered Edge of the Earth with ten riffs and emerged with an explosive metal masterpiece. They didn&rsquo;t waste any time commencing destruction either, and the first track proves that. &quot;&rsquo;Bloodbath and Beyond&rsquo; is almost like a hardcore song. It could&rsquo;ve been an Agnostic Front song. From the first note, you know it&rsquo;s on. The beating starts at the beginning. There&rsquo;s no intro. The vocals, guitars and everything hit you at once,&rdquo Max explains.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>A really special collaboration also happened with Max&rsquo;s sons. As B-Sides, Soulfly re-recorded Sepultura classic &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot; with Zyon Cavalera and Exel&rsquo;s &quot;Your Life, My Life&quot; with Igor Cavalera (his son, not his brother!) &quot;It was cool to record the B-Sides with my kids. Zyon&rsquo;s heartbeat actually opens the original Sepultura record, <em>Chaos A.D.</em> Now he got to record the song with me! Igor plays on an Exel cover that he picked. We always have my family involved on the albums, and this just takes it to the next level,&rdquo he said.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Continuing another legacy, Max takes listeners into different territory again on &quot;Soulfly 7.&quot; He continues, &quot;This &rsquo;Soulfly&rsquo; song came out really easily. I love what Marc did. It&rsquo;s almost like Jimi Hendrix-meets-U2-meets-The-Police. It stands out from the rest of the record because it&rsquo;s so clean. Everything else is really heavy and distorted. This has really clean guitars so it jumps out at you.&quot; It&rsquo;s another heavy psychedelic journey that&rsquo;s both spiritual and strangely soothing.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Marc&rsquo;s six-string experimentation also led to a unique solo on &quot;Rise of the Fallen&quot; and a pensive acoustic outro on &quot;Mega-Doom.&quot; Max lauds him saying, &quot;Marc is such an exciting guitar player. He blew me away again. Marc came up with crazy, electronic sounds. He makes the guitar sound like a computer or a cell phone. It&rsquo;s a bit influenced by Rage Against the Machine. The album is split between those noises and some incredible melodic solos. Marc really outdid himself on <em>Omen</em>.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>All around, <em>Omen</em> functions as portent for Soulfly&rsquo;s future by drawing upon their past. &quot;This is Soulfly&rsquo;s seventh album. With Sepultura, I only did six albums. Soulfly survived the times. It survived the crisis. After it took off with the first record, I never stopped or looked back. I just kept going. We&rsquo;re going to the future with <em>Omen</em>. Metal is still alive and kicking. Because you get older, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to get boring. The older I get, the more psycho I get. The albums get heavier and more aggressive. That&rsquo;s the message of <em>Omen</em>. Music is all I know how to do. It&rsquo;s all I like to do. This album just reaffirms that I can keep rocking.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p><em>Omen</em> signals a new chapter for Soulfly and heavy metal.</p>', 1998, NULL),

You&rsquoll hear something different with each listen.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>The group recorded <em>AUDIO SECRECY</em> with <em>Come What(ever) May</em> producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, Deftones) at Nashville&rsquos Blackbird Studios. When they weren&rsquot working on the album, they spent their free time living in a spook-filled crashpad. &quot;That house put us through hell,&rdquo laughs Taylor. &ldquoIt was really old, so everything was broken down and leaking and infested with wasps and spiders. I&rsquo;d get lost because there were so many damn rooms. It was like living in the Haunted Mansion at Disney World. It did keep us in the right mood, though, so maybe we should thank it in the liner notes.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Stone Sour does a lot of things brilliantly&mdashand they do most of them on <em>AUDIO SECRECY</em>, beginning with &ldquoMission Statement,&rdquo an electrifying track that breaks from the gate with white-knuckle intensity. &ldquoIt punches you in the face and drags you by the hair like a caveman,&quot; laughs Taylor. Prior to the album&rsquos release, the band offered &ldquoMission Statement&rdquo as a free download. Fans responded en masse and the track was downloaded more than a 1,000 times an hour within a two day period.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Among <em>AUDIO SECRECY</em>&rsquos endless highlights is &ldquoSay You&rsquoll Haunt Me,&rdquo a heavy-with-melody rock track that best exemplifies the band&rsquos ability to pull in fans from cross-pollinating directions. At the album&rsquos centerpiece is &ldquoHesitate,&rdquo an epic &ldquoNovember Rain&rdquo-ish type track that&rsquos both melodic and melancholic with orchestral strings and a soaring chorus. About the song&rsquos emotion, Taylor says, &ldquoLyric-wise, I&rsquom writing from a more personal space here. Whether talking about a relationship or being a father or finding my soul mate, I&rsquom putting it out there for everyone to hear and feel and see if anybody can relate.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>The album&rsquos title is a play on words for idiosyncrasy. &ldquoI&rsquom a fan of double meanings and metaphorical speak,&rdquo muses Taylor. &ldquoThere are so many levels to what those two words combined could mean. As a title, it perfectly fit the album.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>For guitarist Josh Rand, the track &ldquoThe Pessimist&rdquo holds a special significance. &quot;It&rsquo;s the heaviest song we&rsquo;ve done up to this point. I spent a day and a half studying the Hindu scale for the lead. The guitar solo for that song has a very Eastern sound.&quot;<strong> </strong>The song sees Rand shredding with a precise, powerful solo that&rsquo;s melodic and metallic. All the while, it preserves a unique feel.&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&quot;The great thing about Stone Sour is that we&rsquove got five writers in the band and the sound is like different pieces of cloth coming together to form a blanket,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;All you have to do is pull the strings a little tighter to bring those pieces together. Everyone in the band brought in material and we came up with an album that&rsquo;s really alive.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&quot;Threadbare&quot; was written by Mayorga and marks a songwriting debut for the drummer. &quot;The band was really cool and encouraged me to throw some music into the hat,&quot; he says. &quot;It&rsquo;s one of the longer, weirder and darker tracks on the record. I&rsquo;m thrilled everyone embraced it and made it a Stone Sour song. It&rsquo;s very progressive, and it makes for a nice little rollercoaster ride.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Economaki goes deeper into the track, adding, &quot;It&rsquo;s absolutely epic. It&rsquo;s got clean melodies and it modulates. It takes the listener to a whole different dimension.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>In addition, Stone Sour&rsquo;s trademark dual guitar assault became even tougher with Jim Root and Josh recording simultaneously. There was no need for them to over-digitize parts or go back and water everything down with Pro Tools. Taking an old school approach, both guitarists entered the booth and ripped away. Says Rand, &quot;We&rsquo;re like five guys playing in a garage and it reflects in the music. There&rsquo;s a song for every mood you can possibly go through in a day.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&ldquoThis album really represents everything we&rsquove been threatening to do,&rdquo says Taylor. &ldquoIt has so many different vibes and styles&hellipit&rsquos probably the best thing I&rsquove done in a long time.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>That&rsquos a helluva statement considering Taylor&rsquos resume, which includes his &ldquoother gig&rdquo as the lead singer of multi-platinum Grammy winning band Slipknot (Root also pulls double-duty, playing guitar for both groups).</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&ldquoI&rsquo;m not trying to change the world, I just want to make music and get some shit off my chest,&rdquo smiles Taylor. &ldquoBut at the end of the day, I hope people dig this record. I hope they grab onto something that they want to sing all day. I hope it gets them excited. I hope it makes them think and I hope it makes them want to start their own bands.

From the swirling grind of &quot;By the Way&quot; to the nasty snarl of &quot;Crutch&quot; to the soaring melodicism of &quot;Not Meant to Be&quot; and &quot;Wait For Me,&quot; <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> is a broad-reaching endeavor that puts Connolly, guitarist Dave Brenner and bassist Dean Back high in the rock pantheon, achieving creative growth without sacrificing the hard-hitting power that got them here in the first place.<br /> <br />&quot;We really dug hard on this one,&quot; Connolly notes. &quot;The longer you&rsquo;re in a band, the more you write songs, the better you get. We&rsquo;ve had such a great opportunity to figure out what to do better, how to write a better song and keep building and building. That&rsquo;s exciting for us.&quot;<br /> <br /><em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> began taking shape in February of 2007, as Theory was winding down from touring to support its second album, 2005&rsquo;s Gasoline, a slump-defying sophomore outing that launched the hits &quot;No Surprise,&quot; &quot;Say Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Santa Monica&quot; and &quot;Hello Lonely (Walk Away From This).&quot; The group returned to Grammy-nominated producer Howard Benson, who in turn issued marching orders that set the tone for the project. <br /> <br />&quot;Before we even went into the studio, Howard wanted to gear this record up to sound huge,&quot; Connolly recalls about Benson&rsquo;s &quot;all killer, no filler&quot; approach to the record. &quot;He said, &lsquoYou have to go into a record with great songs. You can&rsquo;t make them while you&rsquo;re there. You can&rsquo;t just go in with one or two great songs. You&rsquo;ve got to have 10.&rsquo; So we just kept sending him songs until we had the 10 to 12 great ones, and then he said, &rsquo;OK, let&rsquo;s go.&rsquo;&quot;<br /> <br />Theory actually brought about 17 songs to Los Angeles&rsquo; Bay 7 studios in August of 2007. Amidst low-key hijinks -- Brenner and Back grew mustaches, Connolly sported a fake one in the name of band unity -- the group and studio drummer Robin Diaz recorded 15 before choosing the 12 that ultimately comprise Scars &amp Souvenirs, which proved an apt title for the range of emotions Connolly sings about on the album.<br /> <br />&quot;It&rsquo;s the <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> of your life,&quot; he explains. &quot;The songwriting on the record is really about someone&rsquo;s past or and present, their relationships and how they shape everything. It&rsquo;s more metaphorical than physical scars and trophies.&quot;<br /> <br />And while Connolly has certainly done his turn as a rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll king of pain on Gasoline and 2002&rsquo;s attention-catching debut Theory Of A Deadman, he went into <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> determined to show he could be more than the &quot;callous bastard&quot; Rolling Stone magazine called him in an early profile.<br><p>Here, Connolly explores broad new lyrical terrain, indicative of his growth as a person and as songwriter. &quot;For awhile there, every song was, &rsquo;Get the f*&ampk out! I don&rsquo;t need women! Screw them!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s kinda how I felt at that point,&quot; Connolly says with a self-effacing laugh. &quot;But I&rsquo;ve grown as a songwriter, and as a person. I wanted to write some different, nicer songs for a change.&quot;<br /> <br />He didn&rsquo;t have to look hard for inspiration. He wrote &quot;Wait For Me,&quot; with its acoustic guitar underpinning and rich chorus, for his wife, paying tribute to her fortitude in being home alone while he&rsquo;s on the road. The piano-laden &quot;All or Nothing,&quot; meanwhile, chronicles their relationship, which began as a good friendship before blossoming into romance. &quot;It was kind of sick of me writing all these woman-hater songs before,&quot; acknowledges Connolly, whose mother left his family when he was in high school, providing rich source material for his earlier work. &quot;People thought I was writing about my wife.&quot; While Connolly&rsquo;s lyrics have taken on a kinder, gentler pallor on <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em>, the band continues to keep the knobs cranked to 11. <br /> <br />Connolly also went into <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> trying to write some songs that were &quot;just for fun,&quot; and succeeded with tracks such as &quot;End of Summer,&quot; an anthem about the bittersweetness of endings, whether that of a season or a relationship.<br /> <br />But even though the album mines a deeper emotional trough, it charges with the same potent force of its predecessors. When fans eagerly crank up the likes of &quot;So Happy,&quot; &quot;Got it Made&quot; and  &quot;Bad Girlfriend,&quot; they&rsquo;ll end up with a set of blown out speakers, thanks to the firepower that crackles in these rockers, while &quot;Sacrifice&quot; bristles with the kind of primal, super-charged defiance that has long defined the best hard rock. <br /> <br />&quot;A lot of bands, they grow older and they get grayer and they just can&rsquo;t do the rock songs anymore,&quot; Connolly says. &quot;I don&rsquo;t see that happening to us. Fans are gonna hear our record and hear some softer stuff, but we&rsquo;re a rock band. I think it sounds bigger than the other two (albums) we&rsquo;ve done.&quot;<br /> <br />Which is, not surprisingly, why Connolly, Brenner and Back are chomping at the bit to take <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> out on the road. &quot;We really want to take the band farther this time,&quot; Connolly says. &quot;We want to get out there to places we have not been before - where a lot of our fans are --Asia, Australia, as well as reaching our fans in North America and Europe. We&rsquo;re just a hard-working band, man. We want to be out there for a couple of years and play these songs to everybody we possibly can.&quot;</p><br><p>With an album like <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em>, the fans will be lining up to listen.</p>', 2002, NULL),

(49, 'Trivium', '                             As the years fly by at breath-stealing speed, the aim of every self-respecting metal band must surely be to stake a claim for immortality to carve their name with pride into metal&rsquo;s metaphorical Mount Rushmore. In the modern era, as countless new (and not so new) bands jostle for position at the front of the grid, it becomes ever harder to pick the wheat from the chaff, the weak from the strong. But amid such a swarm of mediocrity, the greatest bands always rise effortlessly to the top, building in confidence and momentum with each incremental step forward, learning from their mistakes, gaining nourishment and focus from their triumphs and growing, with gathering speed, into something that truly matters. It&rsquo;s 2008 and Trivium fit that description perfectly. One listen to their jaw-dropping new album, the mighty Shogun, will be all the convincing you need that their time has arrived.<br><p>&quot;We wrote this album exactly the way we all wanted to,&quot; says frontman Matt Heafy. &quot;We really did our own thing this time. When people check it out, they&rsquo;ll realize that we&rsquo;re not an exclusive band. We&rsquo;re not doing this for one specific kind of person. If you want to come to a show and rock out, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for. We&rsquo;re just four normal guys who just happen to be able to play metal for lots of cool people around the world.&quot;</p><br><p>The <strong>Trivium</strong> story began in earnest with the release of their <strong>Roadrunner </strong>debut, 2005&rsquo;s Ascendancy album the perfect way to introduce the band - Heafy, guitarist Corey Beaulieu, bassist Paolo Gregoletto and drummer Travis Smith - to a newly revitalized global metal scene.  The album exhibited great depth and musicality, and immediately set the band apart from the pack, turning them into one of the most widely hailed bands the genre had produced in years.</p><br><p>In the US,  Europe, Japan and Australia - and particularly in the UK, where Trivium shot from nowhere to conquering the annual Download Festival at Castle Donington and becoming a major headlining act - Heafy and co. were making major waves, touring relentlessly around the globe and building up a huge international fan base.</p><br><p>Released in the autumn of 2006 - a mere 18 months after its predecessor - <strong>Trivium</strong>&rsquo;s second <strong>Roadrunner</strong> release <strong><em>The Crusade</em></strong> was a massive milestone a bold, and adventurous move that both consolidated their reputation as metal&rsquo;s fastest rising young band and proved that unlike their peers, <strong>Trivium</strong> were more than happy to take a few risks in order to further nurture their art.</p><br><p>Buoyed by critical acclaim, a hugely positive response from the fans and a seemingly never-ending stream of high profile tours, including a successful cross-Europe joint as special guests to Iron Maiden and a triumphant stint on the Ozzfest tour in the US, <strong>Trivium</strong> quickly threw themselves into the writing process for Shogun, spending many on-the-road hours honing and refining their newest material in anticipation of hitting the studio, this time with renowned producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters/Stone Sour/Death Angel).</p><br><p>&quot;We were writing on tour for a year straight,&quot; says Heafy. &quot;When we were on the Black Crusade tour in Australia, I showed the <strong>Machine Head</strong> guys the songs. I respect Robb Flynn such an incredible amount as a musician and a person and I wanted to know what he thought. He called me up and gave me a really good talk about demoing and revisiting songs and all that, so we went back to the rehearsal studio and completely re-wrote everything. Then we sent the stuff to Nick, and then between us we picked the 13 best songs. We went to Franklin, Tennessee, where we lived for eight weeks, and recorded at Sound Kitchen Studios. It&rsquo;s a legendary country music studio where Willie Nelson recorded. Everyone was amazing and so nice, so it was a great working environment for us.&quot;</p><br><p>There is a moment for every great band when everything comes together and a definitive musical identity emerges. For <strong>Trivium</strong>, this is it. The collaboration with Raskulinecz has taken <strong>Trivium</strong> to new compositional and technical levels, while the album&rsquo;s brutal, bone-shattering production means that they&rsquo;ve never sounded heavier or more powerful. With lashings of vicious riffs that celebrate the band&rsquo;s love of death, black and thrash metal, alongside the most incisive and memorable melodies the quartet have ever written, Shogun is a monstrous achievement that promises to have the cynics and naysayers choking on their toast.</p><br><p>&quot;It was all very natural,&quot; explains Heafy. &quot;We didn&rsquo;t care what was going to come out, and that&rsquo;s why it sounds this way. We all still love extremely heavy music with the brutality and no melody, but we also love stuff that&rsquo;s incredibly melodic and simple and memorable, so that explains the two extremes. We like to have everything. Vocally we tried everything from the lowest note I can sing to the highest note, from the lowest growl to the highest scream, and everything in between. We wanted to try it all. That was the whole concept behind the record. No limits!&quot;</p><br><p>Although <em><strong>Shogun</strong></em> is not a concept album in the traditional sense, the influence of Heafy&rsquo;s own Japanese background - its warrior culture, its strong sense of pride - is present through every last second of these powerful, emotive metal anthems. Both opener &quot;Kirisute Gomen&quot; and the album&rsquo;s mighty 12-minute title track are perfect examples of this, as Heafy explains. &quot; &lsquoKirisute Gomen&quot; was an ancient Samurai code that basically meant that if you angered a Samurai or pissed them off, they&rsquo;d have to chop your head off,&quot; states Heafy. &quot;It was like the martial law of the Samurai. The title of the album came to me when we were on our second tour of Japan, and I was on a bus tour and they were talking about how the <em><strong>Shogun</strong></em> were the highest ranking military generals. It was the coolest name I&rsquo;d ever heard before, so I knew I&rsquo;d use it for something some day. When we started writing this music and I heard how epic it all was, I said to the guys &lsquoI&rsquo;ve had this title in my head for ages, how do you think it&rsquo;d work as the title of the album?&rsquo; and they loved it too. The definition of the word just commands strength and it feels powerful, so it was perfect.&quot;</p><br><p>Alongside tales of ancient Japan, the album also delves into the brain-boggling world of ancient Greek mythology, with songs like &quot;Torn Between Scylla And Charybdis&quot; and &quot;Of Prometheus And The Crucifix&quot; revelling in the imagery and drama of symbolic sagas first told many thousands of years ago.</p><br><p>&quot;When you look at something like religion, people seem to take those stories as true events that really happened,&quot; states Heafy. &quot;With mythology, everyone knew these were stories created, and used them as ways to help live their lives better or to help them to cope with things. So I&rsquo;ve used those myths as a tool to help further develop the lyrics.&quot;</p><br><p><strong>Trivium</strong> have been threatening to make that final leap from established contenders to full-on metal heroes for the last few years, and with <em><strong>Shogun</strong></em>, their fourth and manifestly best album to date, they have clearly mastered the metal arts and are ready to step into the arena with the genre&rsquo;s greats. From the bludgeoning bombast of &quot;Kirisute Gomen&quot; through to the hook-laden savagery of &quot;Down From The Sky&quot; and &quot;Into The Mouth Of Hell We March&quot;, and on to the towering steel-plated genius of &quot;Shogun&quot; itself, this is truly <strong>Trivium</strong>&rsquo;s defining album and the first stone-cold classic of their career. With over 800 live shows under their belt to date, Florida&rsquo;s finest are ready to hit the road again and this time they have both the songs and the self-belief to take on all-comers.</p><br><p>&quot;This first shows we do for this album are gonna be just us, our instruments and the music,&quot; says Heafy with obvious pride. &quot;There&rsquo;s not going to be any fancy shit going on. It&rsquo;s just gonna be raw, brutal and exactly what this album is. It&rsquo;s about the music, and that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re about. We hope everyone comes out to see us and we hope you all dig the record. We&rsquo;re really proud of it.&quot;</p><br><p><em><strong>Shogun</strong></em> is set for release on September 30th.</p>', 2005, NULL),

Now, with a new deal with Roadrunner Records and their epic new album, <strong><em>The Heart of Everything</em></strong>, the band seems destined bring its majestic, emotion-swept music to new heights.</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotWe pushed ourselves to make these songs the best that we could,&quot says Westerholt of the new record. &quotWe wanted to have a more organic feeling and more energy than ever. I think our last one, [2004&#39s <em>The Silent Force</em>], went a bit too far in one direction at times the orchestra pushed away the drums and guitars. This time we tried to get the guitars more prominent and have more riffs. It still has a big feeling and there&#39s still plenty of classical parts, but I think we did it without losing the power of the band.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p><em>The Heart of Everything</em>, Within Temptation has never sounded more powerful or alive. The first single &quotWhat Have You Done,&quot featuring <strong>Keith Caputo</strong> of Life of Agony, which see-saws between caustic guitar crunch and gothy, gauzy textures, is the perfect marriage of melodic rock and metal. The equally powerful track &quotThe Howling&quot showcases Den Adel&#39s trademark haunting vocals and soaring melodies, while the glacial &quotFrozen,&quot features heartrending vocals and staccato string bursts and &quotThe Cross&quot which starts like an intro to a film score, segues into a winding, dramatic number that&#39s equal parts Richard Wagner, The Gathering and Kate Bush.</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotOur biggest goal besides writing the best songs we can was to give this record more energy than the last one,&quot says singer Sharon den Adel. &quotI used my voice in a different way on every song. Sometimes it&#39s high and melodic, almost classical, and in some songs it&#39s lower with power.&quot </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotWe made very careful choices when we were writing these songs,&quot adds Westerholt. &quotWe didn&#39t use orchestra everywhere and we also cut down a bit in the layering of the arrangements so they were more efficient and had less choruses so they could work better together with the band.&quot </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>While Within Temptation was more selective about their compositions and less effusive with their classical elements, they experimented as much as ever, adding mandolin to &quotThe Cross,&quot cello to four tracks and working with the Prague Orchestra instead of individual players or synthetic strings. </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotWe like to try different things and when we&#39re writing a song, we never know where that inspiration comes from,&quot adds Den Adel. &quotIt&#39s always very spontaneous and that&#39s what makes the music unique.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>The band chose the album title <em>The Heart of Everything</em> because the songs address feelings and ideas that exist under the surface and can&#39t be excavated without introspection. &quotSo often, we live our lives without thinking,&quot Westerholt explains. &quotWe just do things because we&#39re born in a certain environment and people are expecting certain things from you. Sometimes its important to look within yourself and discover what really makes you happy and what&#39s important to you.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>In their search for self-discovery, Within Temptation address a variety of subjects, including the futility of war (&quotOur Solemn Hour&quot), the strength of unconditional love (&quotForgiven&quot) and personal hardships faced by certain bandmembers (&quotThe Cross&quot). Books inspired some tracks, like &quotHand of Sorrow.&quot Others were based on films. </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotWe wrote &lsquoThe Heart of Everything&#39 after watching &lsquoBraveheart,&#39 says Westerholt. &quotAnd &lsquoThe Truth Beneath the Rose&#39 is based on &lsquoThe Da Vinci Code&#39 and is about the idea that belief is sometimes used to justify sins. On the other hand, it may be more important with belief that it&#39s your own belief and you can stand behind it instead of following the belief other people may want to put upon you.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>Within Temptation started writing the new songs at the end of 2005 and fine-tuned the material until late 2006. &quotWe take our time to make our record,&quot explains Den Adel. &quotWe are not easily satisfied with ourselves, and the recording process is very time consuming because we record many instruments and sounds on our record beside the usual band stuff.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotActually, this was our fastest follow-up,&quot adds Westerholt. &quotSo I think this was our easiest album to do. However, no album is ever really easy because there are big ups and downs in the writing and recording process. But in comparison to the other ones, this one felt the best.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>With good reason. <em>The Heart of Everything</em> recaptures everything Within Temptation has thrived upon while taking their music to newer, more thrilling places. And in the process, through all the melancholy atmospheres, cinematic riffs and angelic vocals, the band delivers its most pragmatic and proactive message to date. </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotIf you want to make something out of your life, it&#39s in your own hands,&quot Westerholt says. &quotLife can sometimes be pretty rough and not very easy, but still you have a lot of power within yourself and there&#39s always the possibility to bend things your own way.&quot</p>    ', 2007, NULL),

(52, '3 Inches of Blood', '                             <p>There&#39s a reason fans have come to their shows wearing Viking helmets and brandishing both real and plastic swords. Born out of a love for pure metal, weaned on a diet of fantasy and mythology, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> have been slaying the infidel and defending the faith for nearly eight years. </p>      <p>In that time, they&#39ve released two albums and splattered the ground with crimson streaks while on tour with Satyricon, Black Dahlia Murder, Motorhead and Cradle of Filth. These are mighty accomplishments for dedicated warriors from Vancouver, British Columbia, a region that&#39s not exactly the Camelot of heavy metal. And with their new album, <strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong>, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> have surpassed even their own manly exploits, crafting a baker&#39s dozen of anthems and stormers that crash, rip and roar like a Medieval skirmish.<br /><br /> &quotWith this album, the blacksmith is heating up the blades and we are preparing for battle,&quot says vocalist Jamie Hooper. &quotWe are forging the steel that we&#39ll use to annihilate the heavy metal posers, and in every town we play, the streets will run red with their blood.&quot</p>    <p>Throughout <strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong>, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> demonstrate that the best way to stay ahead of the heavy metal curve is to write music that comes from the heart and sounds nothing like the horde of bands tapping into the latest trends. To that end, they draw fuel from their favorite artists, including Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Manowar and Enslaved and compile it all into their own lethal potion. Once more, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> demonstrate great skill for riding galloping steeds into fiery realms of crunching riffs and banging heads, but <strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong> is darker and more aggressive than 2004&#39s critically acclaimed <strong><em>Advance and Vanquish</em></strong>. &quotDemon&#39s Blade&quot starts with a crushing, technical thrash passage and peaks with twin guitar harmonies over throat-shredding vocals and &quotInfinite Legions&quot features hailstorm blast beats and orchestral swells between martial riffs.</p>    <p>&quotThis album is heavily influenced by low quality beer, bong rips and listening to black metal in the dark,&quot Hooper says. &quotIt doesn&#39t sound blatantly black metal, it still sounds like us. But it&#39s a faster, more intense version of us.&quot</p>    <p><strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong> marks the recording debut of four out of six of the bandmembers. Hooper, who co-formed the group, and co-vocalist Cam Pipes are the only soldiers to return from the last battle, and they&#39re joined by guitarists Shane Clark, Justin Hagberg, bassist Nick Cates and drummer Alexei Rodriguez. But even though the lineup is different, the aesthetic remains the same, and the skill level actually eclipses that of the last record. </p>    <p>&quotSometimes when bands change members it seems like big step backwards, but this was a major step forwards for us,&quot Hooper says. &quotEveryone new who came in was at their best, which forced everybody else to pick up their game a little bit and we came up with things we just couldn&#39t have done before.&quot</p>    <p>Also adding to the skull-splintering vibe was Slipknot drummer <strong>Joey Jordison</strong>, who produced the record. Jordison became a fan of <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> in 2004 when he filled in for Satyricon on tour and <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> opened. &quotWhen he found out we were doing another record, he offered his services, and we were like, &lsquoDude, of course!&quot Hooper says. &quotHe added a fresh perspective to the songs and helped us work on some parts and arrangements. Also, he&#39s a beer drinking encyclopedia of cult black metal, so we sat around drinking Pabst Blue Ribbons talking about necro black metal the whole time, which was awesome.&quot</p>    <p><strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> started writing <em><strong>Fire Up the Blades</strong> </em>in late 2006 and composed many of the songs in a house they rented in Tacoma, Washington early this year. They entered the studio with Jordison in October and recorded at three locations in Vancouver -- The Armory, Mushroom Studios and Hipposonic -- before finishing up at London Bridge Studios in Seattle. </p>    <p>&quotOur engineer saw a ghost, but other than that, everything went smoothly,&quot Hooper says. &quotNo one was tearing their hair out or yelling at each other. We were just drinking, having a good time and churning out the metal.&quot<br /> </p>    <p>Hooper co-formed <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> in Victoria, British Columbia in 2000. In addition to a batch of musicians who are long gone, he recruited singer Cam Pipes, whose high pitched shrieks both contrast with and compliment Hooper&#39s vicious growls. In 2001 the group released its debut, <strong><em>Battlecry Under a Winter Sun</em></strong>, which was released by a label owned by a local record store. When the shop closed, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> self-financed additional pressings of the album, which laid the foundation for the band&#39s epic style of music with songs like &quotDestroy the Orcs,&quot &quotSkeletal Onslaught&quot and &quotHeadwaters of the River of Blood.&quot<br /><br /> &quotWhen we started, a lot of us came out of this DIY scene where most of the bands had some sort of message,&quot Hooper says. &quotI support that, but we wanted to be band that was just about good times, and would just cut loose. The music that we love and puts smiles on our faces is classic metal. And, we&#39re all fans of shitty movies and fantasy novels, so we decided to use that stuff as well in our music.&quot</p>    <p>Compelled by the band&#39s dedication and determination, Roadrunner Records signed <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> and in 2004 released <strong><em>Advance and Vanquish</em></strong>, an album that brought to mind the best of bands like Running Wild, Grave Digger, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Diamond Head. As triumphant as it was, its creation was a long and bloody process. &quotWe went through about 12 records worth of bullshit making that,&quot says Hooper. &quotOn the first day of recording, our drummer and bass player quit. So we had to replace them with guys who basically learned the songs as we were recording them. And, after we recorded, our two guitar players quit. But then our new guitarists [Hagberg and Clark] joined and we were like, &lsquoAlright, it&#39s <em>go</em> time.&#39&quot</p>    <p>Which brings us back to <strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong>, an album that combines fist-tight musicianship, rib-sticking riffs and more monsters and mayhem than a game of <em>Dungeons &amp Dragons</em>. No longer, do <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> sing about pirates and cyborgs, now they&#39re more rooted to a dark, mystical era when great beasts roamed the land, and a man was defined by the strength of his armor and the power of his sword. </p>    <p>&quotThe general theme of the whole thing is that we are all united in battle,&quot Hooper says. &quotBut a lot of the songs are also about the imagined Christian demons coming forth from their imaginations and reaping the whirlwind, so to speak. It&#39s more of a post-apocalyptic doom scenario. &lsquo&#39Mad Max&#39 barren wasteland, everybody&#39s fucked kind of stuff.&quot</p>    <p>While <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> are eager to see how fans react to their new album, and are even looking forward to the return of the kids with swords and shields, they&#39re also curious about what new kinds of lunatics will pop up at their shows. &quotThe music&#39s more extreme now, but I don&#39t know how much more extreme some of these fans can get,&quot Hooper says. &quotIn Cincinnati, we had a fellow come onstage with a pig&#39s head on a stick. He fell down and dropped the head and we had to soccer ball kick it off the stage. Then, in Fargo, North Dakota, a guy came on holding a severed deer&#39s head over his head. The tongue was sticking out and blood was dripping all over his face. How much more metal can you get than that?&quot </p>    Take a running dive into <strong><em>The Blades</em></strong>, and find out.', 2004, NULL),
(53, '36 Crazyfists', '                             Despite the state of today&#39s tumultuous world, the Alaska-bred, melodic metal band <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong> are inspired to look beyond the negative and aggressively emphasize the positive. They are able to distance themselves from the pack by never resorting to stereotypical metal rage while maintaining their heavy roots.  Whether front man Brock Lindow addresses road fatigue, self-worth or accountability, the music is fueled by a contagious enthusiasm and optimism in the face of frustration.   The band&#39s third album <em>Rest Inside The Flames</em> is a record of this and comes across as an energized batch of modern anthems built upon a pyre of swarming emotions, stomping, surging rhythms and vocals that seesaw between scathing rage and melodic regret. And the band&#39s universal, contemporary sounds are earning them an army of fans across the world, especially in Europe, where they have been embraced by thousands of people, playing main stages at some of the biggest rock festivals on the continent.  It&#39s easy to see why. <em>Rest Inside The Flames</em> offers a fresh take on aggressive music that simultaneously revels in strength and vulnerability, while carving a path of self-reliance and personal expression as wide as an ocean basin.   &quotI&#39ll Go Until My Heart Stops&quot begins with a barked verse that builds into a climactic roar before leveling off in a contagious chorus. &quotElysium,&quot is a colossal slab of brutality filled with dense, chugging breakdowns, yet buoyed by unexpected blasts of melody. And &quotThe Great Descent&quot opens with a plangent guitar arpeggio and pain-stricken vocals before building into a hailstorm of slamming beats and angular riffs. In addition to being more lyrically revealing the album is also more musically developed and heavier than their previous work. &quotThere&#39s a lot more double-bass than before and a lot more mosh parts,&quot Lindow says. &quotWe&#39ve always been pretty heavy live, but it hasn&#39t really translated on record before. So, with this one, there was more of a focus to make sure the songs would rock as hard on the record as they will in concert.&quot    A perfect juxtaposition to the thematic heaviness of some tracks, &quotAurora&quot is about the magnificence of the Northern Lights and how they reflect the magic of love and life.  &quotOn Any Given Night&quot addresses the quest to stay upbeat when thousands of miles away from friends and family and &quotMidnight Swim&quot is about having the strength to take advantage of second chances. &quotWe live in a country where you can chase your dreams and have more than one chance to make them happen,&quot Lindow says. &quotThe song is about the people who chase dreams and the journey that goes along with that.&quot   <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong> started working on <em>Rest Inside The Flames</em> in February 2005, less than two months after they stopped touring behind <em>A Snow Capped Romance</em>. By September they had most of the songs written and in October they entered the studio with producer Sal Villaneuva, who has worked on albums by bands like Thursday and Taking Back Sunday. Lindow says. &quotHe is very melodically in tune, but he also knows how to get killer metal tones, so it was awesome working with him.&quot  While the sessions were long and sometimes grueling, the band generally enjoyed the recording process -- especially when friends came over to help them out. Former touring partner and Killswitch Engage singer Howard Jones fulfilled an old promise to collaborate with the band by adding guest vocals to &quotElysium&quot and Only Living Witness singer Jonah Jenkins pitched in on &quotWe Cannot Deny.&quot  &quotOnly Living Witness was one of our favorite bands growing up, so we really wanted him to be on the record,&quot Lindow says. &quotOver the years, I made friends with him online, which is a little weird. But he lives in Boston so he came down to New Jersey when we were recording, and that was awesome.&quot  Formed in Anchorage, Alaska in 1994, <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong> named themselves after a Jackie Chan film, and immediately created a buzz coming out of the frigid scene. When their original bassist died in a car accident in 1996, they moved to Portland, Oregon and persevered. They soon made friends with propulsive thrash band Skinlab, who passed their demo to the A&ampR department at Roadrunner Records. They were signed in 2000 and immediately entered the studio to work on their debut album <em>Bitterness The Star</em> which came out in 2002 established the band as a powerful new force.     Lindow grew up quite a bit since then and his new lease on life shone through <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong>&#39 2004 album <em>A Snow Capped Romance</em>, which showcased positive lyrics with accompanying heartrending melodies that shared elements in common with emotionally expulsive performers like Thursday and Thrice. The band supported the disc on tours with Killswitch Engage and Poison the Well and remained on the road until December 2004. A month later, the band started writing songs for <em>Rest Inside The Flames</em>. From the ominous arpeggios and ecstatic, distorted ring of &quotFelt Through a Phone Line&quot to the skewed chug and harmonized chorus of &quotOn Any Given Night&quot to the tumbling beats and barbed licks of  &quotMidnight Swim,&quot <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong> gives a new twist to familiar themes and leaves listeners energized with fists clenched.  &quotWe have fun making music and I think that comes across,&quot concludes Lindow. &quotHopefully, at the same time, we can connect with people and help them deal with whatever&#39s going on in their lives so they can have a good time as well. That&#39s what it&#39s about for me, trying to connect with people and hopefully everybody&#39s enjoying themselves and having a good time.&quot', 2002, NULL),
(54, 'Amanda Palmer', '                             The idea was a simple one:  songs for the piano and voice, recorded in one week in a bedroom, just to get them down on tape.  But like all things surrounding <strong>The Dresden Dolls&rsquo; Amanda Palmer</strong> &ndash a one-woman machine who is a rock musician, artist, writer, yoga enthusiast, political activist and more &ndash simplicity is not an easy thing to come by.  Her small idea snowballed into something grand, exciting and nothing short of brilliant in the form of her debut solo album, <strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong>.<br /><br />Born and raised in the Boston, &quot;simple&quot; has never been a way to describe <strong>Amanda Palmer&rsquo;s</strong> undeniable talent and passion for creating art.  With years of theater and performance art studies under her belt, Palmer has always sought to merge the worlds of rock music, theater and performance art...even when it&rsquo;s meant biting off more than she can conceivably chew (Palmer, never one to shy from a challenge, always finds a way to get it done, and to do it well).  Post-college, she was notorious around Boston as a &quot;living statue&quot; street performer, art-party impresario and DIY theater director.   And, occasionally, a piano-bashing singer-songwriter, setting up shop in small galleries and friends&rsquo; parties and sharing what would eventually become the first batch of songs for The Dresden Dolls.  Upon meeting drummer Brian Viglione at a party in 2000, The Dresden Dolls were born, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Until history took a bit of a turn.  With multiple critically-acclaimed records under her belt, Palmer could have easily continued on that trajectory &ndash but as the band hit their consecutive fifth year of touring, Palmer decided to take a breather and create her first solo album - a stripped-down piano-and-voice affair to be recorded at home.  &quot;I was all set to just bang out the tunes in my bedroom with the help of a local engineer and was locking the dates when Ben Folds showed up on the scene. He emailed the band&rsquo;s website while he was on tour in Japan, gushing about how much he loved our records. I was totally ecstatic and jumped up and down for a while and then dug out my old Ben Folds CDs and wrote him back immediately,&quot; explains Palmer.  &quot;We struck up a fast friendship, and fate would have it that we were both in Australia a few weeks later, so we met up and had a good old-fashioned geeky-piano-songwriter-bonding session.  He told me that if I ever needed to use his chock-full-o-pianos studio in Nashville, he&rsquo;d be happy to loan it. I told him that, as a matter of fact, I was plotting a solo album and would love to make use of it. He stopped and thought for a second, asked me if he could produce the record and I said yes without blinking an eye...I just had a good feeling about it and knew I could trust him. And I wound up being blown away by what Ben brought to the table, he went beyond my expectations in spades.&quot;<br />The resulting sessions culminated in Palmer&rsquo;s solo record, Who Killed Amanda Palmer.  Spanning almost ten years&rsquo; worth of songwriting, Palmer had nearly thirty compositions to sort through with Folds when she finally went down to Nashville to begin working on them.  &quot;My recent songs, like &rsquo;Point of It All&rsquo; and &rsquo;Guitar Hero&rsquo; all seemed like no-brainers because they represent a newer and mature kind of songwriting for me, but there were some older ones that Ben was curious about, like &rsquo;Runs in the Family&rsquo; that I tried to veto, and, well, Ben won,&quot; Palmer says.  &quot;Other songs like &rsquo;Blake Says&rsquo; were written in my mid-twenties and had always had a place close to my heart &ndash I knew they had to go on the album. But Ben was really merciless about separating out the wheat from the chaff, and it really paid off. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single weak link on the record.&quot;  With the songs picked, recording commenced in marathon sessions in spring of 2007, with Ben Folds acting as producer and back-up one-man-band, and the creative process in full swing. <br />&quot;From there, the project stretched from a two week side project into a year-long epic project,&quot; she continues.  &quot;Ben was a madman in the studio. He had a wicked sense of humor and a perfect touch with sounds and ideas. He was able to see what I missed. I thought that &rsquo;Melissa Mahoney&rsquo; was too silly to go on the record&hellipI mean, come on, it&rsquo;s a pop song about abortion. But Ben took the joke, ran with it, added back-up singers and NAILED it to the wall. He knew exactly when to take an idea too far and when to pull back. The amount of magic he added to the songs is just unbelievable.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We weren&rsquo;t working with a strict deadline, so we got to try a lot of things and throw them away,&quot; Palmer continues.  This experimentation also gave Palmer the opportunity to invite some of her own favorite musicians to play on the songs, resulting in guest turns from the likes of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Annie Clark (on a twisted version of Carousel&rsquo;s &quot;What&rsquo;s the Use of Wondrin&quot;), The Dead Kennedys&rsquo; East Bay Ray and Rasputina&rsquo;s Zoe Keating. Mr. Folds, in addition to producing and arranging, played synthesizer, drums, organ and contributed some back-up vocals on the record. He also introduced Palmer to his trusted and critically-acclaimed string arranger Paul Buckmaster, who supplied gorgeous string and orchestral arrangements for four songs on the record and conducted the sessions at LA&rsquo;s historic Studio A at Capitol Records.<br /><br /><strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong>, titled after a Twin Peaks reference that has &quot;come to mean new things,&quot; according to Palmer, gives the listener an entirely new angle by which to view <strong>Amanda Palmer</strong> as a songwriter, vocalist, piano-player and arranger.  &quot;One thing that was always irritated me is that the Dolls get locked in the gimmick box by a lot of people. Many times they don&rsquo;t see past the fun and theatrics, they never actually find the music or experience us live, so they have little idea what the essence of the band is.&quot;  Palmer explains.  &quot;At the core, I&rsquo;m a songwriter and the Dolls are a rock band. We&rsquo;ve earned a great reputation for throwing wonderful events and making our shows feel like big parties, but I&rsquo;m hoping that people can see past that and assess me as a songwriter and performer instead of just a circus ringmaster. I do love that role - and I think the role is an important one - but it&rsquo;s important for me to wave and remind people that I&rsquo;m a human being before I step back into the ring.&quot;<br /><br />The songs on <strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong> do just that.  From the sweeping orchestral opener &quot;Astronaut&quot; to the wild choruses of &quot;Leeds United&quot; to the sinister pop of &quot;Melissa Mahoney,&quot; each song peels back multi-faceted layers of Amanda Palmer, revealing an unbelievably talented woman at the core.  &quot;&rsquo;Astronaut&rsquo; may be my hands-down favorite It feels most representative of where I&rsquo;ve gone as a songwriter,&quot; says Palmer when discussing the songs on the album of which she&rsquo;s proudest.  &quot;But the recording of &rsquo;Leeds United&rsquo; has a great story, which is part of what makes me love that song,&quot; she continues.  &quot;I had just written it and played it for Ben, and we were trying to figure out how we wanted to track it.  I was in Scotland playing at the Fringe Festival, and I had wanted to add the song to the live set, so I called a local trumpet player I knew to come to the venue with some horn-playing friends.  We had one rehearsal and they joined me that night, wearing no pants and lampshades on their heads, on stage for a piano-and-horns version of &rsquo;Leeds United.&rsquo;  It sounded so great that I wanted to capture the arrangement to send to Ben, so I booked us into a teeny, cheap little studio to cut a demo.  That scratch vocal was done in one take, and I&rsquo;d been smoking and drinking all week, since I was done with my engagement and living it up.  I knew there was no way anyone would ever hear it but Ben, but Ben loved it&hellipso it wound up on the record.  It took forever to track down all those Scottish guys to get them to sign releases.&quot; <br />Other songs have taken on new emotional depths as Palmer has seen them take different shapes once they&rsquo;ve hit the stage.  &quot;&rsquo;Strength Through Music,&rsquo; which was inspired by the school shootings at Columbine, took on this whole new quality when I worked it into the stage show with The Danger Ensemble, a performance art group from Australia who are going to be touring with me,&quot; says Palmer.  &quot;Watching actors on stage interpret the meaning of those lyrics was heartbreaking.&quot;   Palmer also collaborated with long-time friend and filmmaker Michael Pope on a film project based on six of the album&rsquo;s songs to be released in pieces in the weeks leading up to the record&rsquo;s street date.  &quot;We filmed &rsquo;Strength&rsquo; in the hallway of my high school with a bunch of teenage drama students. It was incredibly powerful, there were a lot of tears after we cut the first take.&quot;   The film project also includes clips for &quot;Astronaut,&quot; &quot;Guitar Hero,&quot; &quot;Ampersand,&quot; &quot;Runs in the Family&quot; and &quot;Point of It All.&quot;  Extra footage was shot to weave the songs into a complete 30 minute film that connects each song to the next and follows Palmer through a series of painful but liberating realizations.<br /><br /><strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong> evolved from a simple idea to an elaborate process culminating in the finest work of a varied, already-impressive career.  At its center are the words of a masterful story teller, a woman with a wry tongue and a penchant for bold confessionals.  In this way, it makes sense that for the album&rsquo;s liner notes and accompanying mystery concept and photo book, Palmer has teamed up with another artist who successfully merges many worlds into one: best-selling author Neil Gaiman, who is best known as the man who penned the Sandman comic series.  &quot;I met Neil through my good friend Jason Webley,&quot; she says. &quot;We really connected and became a quick little mutual admiration society.  I sent him an early draft of the album and he loved it. When I realized I wanted to release a companion book of bizarre photographs along with the record, I asked if he might want to write the text to a story called &rsquo;Who Killed Amanda Palmer,&rsquo; and he was jazzed at the idea.&quot;  Thus, <strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong> grows even further &ndash a story written within a story sung. Gaiman and Palmer plan to self-publish the book in a limited edition and plant hidden visual clues within the images for further hunting should the reader want to follow the mystery of Who Killed Amanda Palmer down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />Fans who have felt a kinship with Palmer &ndash and there are thousands who pore over her words in her personal blog every day &ndash will feel this bond strengthen even further due to the astonishing forthrightness and vulnerability in these songs.  Those who know the backstory of Palmer&rsquo;s personal struggles and musings will feel at home instantly Palmer has piled every reference, challenge and acceptance from her very vibrant life into this album, inviting the listener into her home, as well as her heart.  <strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong> sees our fearless heroine weaving together the many threads of her personality, her interests, her extensive artistic family, her astute, witty world observations and the stark openness of her feelings into a dynamic record that pushes emotional boundaries while staying true to its genius creator.  From <strong>Amanda Palmer</strong>, we would expect nothing less. <br /><br /><br /><br />', 2008, NULL),

(56, 'Anyone', '                             ANYONE was born from the smoldering remains of a highly experimental trio called SYLVIA in 1995.  Composed of Taylor Hawkins (Foo Fighters) on drums, Juano (Sky Cries Mary) on bass, and singer/songwriter/guitarist Riz Story, the bands short blurred life proved to be the embryo for what would later become the most innovative band of the new millennium.  Story found himself with no rhythm section when Hawkins left to pursue other career opportunities and Juano relocated to Seattle.  He began jamming with soft spoken New Jersey transplant Dave &quotNIPPLES&quot Murray.  Murray had grown tired of the stagnant musical forms back home and had come to Huntington Beach to find a band that could accommodate his power and still be sensitive to his finesse.  The search for a bassist ended when Story and Nipples encountered a strange creature that called itself STATIC. Discussions on the origin of the strange name were silenced when STATIC plugged in his instrument and proceeded to produce the loudest and most heavily distorted bass tone the two had ever heard.  Story then renamed the band ANYONE, a name that he&#39d been saving for his first-born child.  The band then self-released the critically acclaimed &quotLive Acid.&quot  One thousand copies were literally devoured by the Orange County scene in less than a month.  The LP featured 11 cuts all recorded live at the now legendary &quotTOGETHERMENT&quot party.  A large warehouse was secured and ornately decorated by the band, while a film crew was on hand to capture the performance.  The controversial documentary that resulted shocked the alternative underground.  The early buzz on the film, &quotTOGETHERMENT&quot had the media tagging Riz Story a real leader in the O.C. movement.  By 1999 ANYONE had become one of the most celebrated bands in Orange County, taking the Los Angeles Music Awards top honors for best band.  Shows were becoming mini festivals, with projections of Story&#39s films overhead while dancers writhed with the band on stage, all in a heavily decorated venue showered in candy and bits of paper containing propaganda.  The bands dynamic live presentation held these early audiences, which included a vast coming together of fans- rockers, surfers, ravers, punks- in awe.   ANYONE are looked upon as originators of a new sound and a new music scene emerging from Southern California.  Established bands such as Korn and Orgy have raved about this band publicly and Korn even tried to sign the band to their Elementree imprint, but Roadrunner beat them to the punch in late 1999.  In May of 2000 the band left for Seattle&#39s London Bridge studios to work with noted producer Rick Parasher (Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Blind Melon).  Story and Parasher co-produced 14 tracks.  An additional track was co-produced by Story and producer Andrew (MUDROCK) Murdock (Godsmack, Powerman 2000).  Mudrock was brought in to co-mix the album with Story.  The band felt that he could help capture the sonic bomb blast that had stunned live audiences and defined the band&#39s signature, revolutionary sound.  First listening reveals influences as broad as Zeppelin, Jane&#39s Addiction, and Pink Floyd.  The album is packed with trippy, experimental guitar riffs, funk/punk influenced bass lines and energetic, mood-setting drum tones.  Riz&#39s razor sharp voice cuts through each song, spitting out lyrics that demand the listener&#39s attention.  This album will open your mind to the explosive, worldly sound that is ANYONE.    The 16 songs that comprise Anyone&#39s debut are an eclectic array of moods expressed through sound.  The opening track, &quotGiving Thrills&quot is an invitation to become a part of the ANYONE experience. It causes the listener to face the reality of life as a collection of the ridiculous, to face the chaos.  &quotDon&#39t Wake Me&quot is a dreamer&#39s anthem full of sublimely controlled sonic debris.  &quotWhole World&#39s Insane&quot opens with primal screams and develops into a sound that is best described as musical insanity.  It is a song that leaves you with voices in your own head, repeating the catchy &quotUh-huh-a, Uh-huh-a&quot chorus long after the first listen is complete.  &quotHitches&quot is ANYONE&#39s term for obstacles or a problems that kept you from getting through the day.  It is a song laced with heavy down trodden guitar and bass riffs that serve as the background for Riz&#39s lacerating vocals.    11 months in the making, ANYONE&#39s self-titled album stands as an invitation to join in and embrace the sonic boom.  Great hooks, explosive energy, compelling lyrics and a totally unique and new soundï¿½ welcome to ANYONE.  ', 2002, NULL),
(58, 'Biffy Clyro', '                             <p>Drive for an hour so outside Glasgow, you&#39ll find an unassuming little town called Ayr. It&#39s a pretty but unremarkable place certainly not the sort of place you expect revolutions to start. But then, if we know anything about revolutions, it&#39s that they never happen quite when or where you expect.</p>    <p>You&#39ll have heard of <strong>biffy clyro</strong> before of course. About how Simon Neil and schoolfriend twins James and Ben Johnston formed their first band as young teenagers at school in the nearby town of Kilmarnock in 1995 over a shared love of experimental rock and hardcore. You&#39ll know something of how they earned an army of rabidly devotional fans - christened Team Biffy - who  followed them across the country and beyond, their hearts swelling with the searing emotion their minds expanded by the threesome&#39s inventive rock that somehow managed to hit them in the gut at the same time. And you&#39ll probably know about their three albums &#39Blackened Sky&#39, &#39The Vertigo Of Bliss&#39 and &#39Infinity Land&#39, which slowly - and on their own terms - saw them notch up higher and higher chart positions. </p>What you might not know is that in the two-and-a-half years since &#39Infinity Land&#39, they&#39ve been hard at work making what could just be the next truly, historically, important rock record to come out of the British Isles. It&#39s called <strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> and it&#39s  <p>coming your way. Of course, Simon Neil, James and Ben never actually stopped. During biffy&#39s brief hiatus, all three have been kept bust with extra-curricular underground work. And the experience of making some of the most &#39out-there&#39 music of their careers only fuelled their desire that when they did come back, it would be their biggest, best - but also strangest - yet.</p>    <p>To help them make <strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong>, they chose Canadian producer Garth Richardson, inspired by his work with Rage Against The Machine and Kerbdog, and an innate sense of his &quotgreat vibe.&quot The venture saw them fly to Vancouver, then to Richardson&#39s stunning ranch studio in the forests of Gibson to record their masterwork. The collaboration bore exceptional fruit, but the band admit it took time - after recording their previous three albums on a budget and at speed - to adapt to recording in the same way as their heroes.</p>    <p>Explains Simon: &quotFor the first week we had to really slow down how we were doing things. We&#39re used to a hundred miles an hour, but we would have burnt out after a week. We needed a lot more patience about it, but the results are worth it. It took Garth a few days to realise how headstrong we were. We&#39re up for collaborating, but this is our record and we very much are doing what we want to do. It took him a few days to realise that we were going to reject some of his ideas as much as we would collaborate.&quot</p>    <p>From Vancouver, they decamped to New York to mix the album with Andy Wallace - who also handled &#39Nevermind&#39. Artwork,  meanwhile, has been handled by Storm Thorgerson the man behind Classic Rock records both old (Pink Floyd) and new (Muse).</p>  <p>From the apocalyptic opener &#39Living Is A Problem Because Everything Dies&#39, its clear that they have out-biffed the biff. 2001 A Space Odyssey by way of Wagner and Rage Against The Machine, it boasts a stunning baroque choral arrangement and strings by Hollywood arranger Graeme Revell (&lsquoSin City&#39, &lsquoThe Crow&#39, &lsquoFrom Dusk Til Dawn&#39). It&#39s a gigantic, ostentatious raising of their game.</p>    <p>&quotWe&#39ve always been very ambitious in the music we wanted to make,&quot says Simon. &quotIt was never just about guitars bass and drums, even though we&#39re a three-piece. On our records we&#39ve always tried to use as much weird shit as possible.&quot</p><strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> has seen the band finally realise the sound in their heads, it also sees them anchor some of their most outlandish ideas (check the staggering &#399/15ths&#39 for evidence that they&#39ve done anything but gone soft) with the sort of clear and crisp  <p>melodies that this three-headed powerhouse have been hinting at since the days of &#39Justboy&#39 and &#3927&#39. From soaring download single &#39semi-mental&#39 through to the bludgeoning punch of &#39Saturday Superhouse&#39 through the swollen intensity of the slow-burning &#39As Dust Dances&#39 to the glorious foot-stomping live favourite &#39Who&#39s Got A Match?&#39, <strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> packs an emotional punch with 24-carat choruses shot through with biffy&#39s trademark sideways approach to songwriting.</p>    <p>The band admit that this new directness is the result of their searing five-year apprenticeship, working through their ideas and growing into a truly world-beating band. </p>      <p>&quotWe&#39d normally have maybe hidden moments like that before,&quot admits Simon. &quotMaybe because the lyrics are a bit more personal this time, it felt as though the music should breathe a bit more. A song like &#39As Dust Dances&#39, we&#39d just kind of played it and were hypnotising ourselves by playing it rather than trying to rock it up or anything it just felt right, the song&#39s hardly changed since you first heard it. We maybe wouldn&#39t have enjoyed playing that song five years ago, we&#39d have been so restless we wouldn&#39t have felt comfortable, but now we feel as though we can do that, and it works. Rather than trying to cram maybe 100 ideas into ten seconds, leaving them out it can sometimes make things better.&quot </p>  <p><strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> might be crammed with glorious rock songs designed to unite as many people as possible in the power of hard rock but lyrically it&#39s been an altogether more traumatic process. Written in the shadow of the loss of Simon&#39s mother, the album in many ways charts the process of Simon coming to terms with his feelings, and finding ways to move forward. And this is never more extreme than on the album&#39s devastating climax, &#39Machines&#39.</p>    <p>Says Simon: &quotIt&#39s about how your mind works after having a serious grievance in your life how at some points you&#39re really angry at yourself and everybody, at other points you just feel so sad and then you start imagining what death&#39s like and you</p>    <p>suddenly get these vivid pictures of what you think they&#39re gonna be, and then doubting yourself and feeling better and then having a bit of hope. The album&#39s not in that order, but that&#39s what&#39s going on.&quot </p>  <p>Above all, <strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> is the definitive statement - so far - from a band that believers have always known would take on the world one day. The band themselves are far too humble to take notice of the increasing number of voices calling them &quotthe British</p>  <p>Nirvana&quot. What it does do is set a watermark, and usher in a new age of British hard rock in the same way &#39Nevermind&#39 did all those years ago. We just want to make records that people can listen to in 20 years and think they&#39re good fucking records,&quot says Simon in conclusion. &quotWe believe that if we follow what we want to do, which is very much our own take on things, that things will sound honest and real in 20 years time because there&#39s gonna be no schtick associated with it. We&#39re not dressed crazily, people stood up and took notice because we were making great music, and people had to stand up and pay attention, so I think if that can apply over three or four years, then I just hope that in 20 years it still applies. That&#39s what we want to do we want to be an important band. And we think we are.&quot</p>', 2007, NULL),
(59, 'Biohazard', '                             (taken from the liner notes of the 1998 reissue of <u>Urban Discipline</u>)  Six years after it was first released, <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> is still as fresh as the damage from a smoking gun, still as human as the ambulance crew that takes away another victim, still as angry as the friends that are left behind, and of course, still as loud and powerful as the initial blast. See, by capturing their own little piece of tough city life so well, <strong>Biohazard</strong> had, without even realizing it at the time, captured so many of our lives. As I write, thousands of miles from where this album was actually recorded, it&#39s with the knowledge that two friends will be buried this week. Next week it could be your friends who get killed or your kids playing in the chalk outlineï¿½ Even the sleeve to URBAN DISCIPLINE tells a story.  ï¿½The idea was that children are pure and untainted by society until society gets them,ï¿½ explains vocalist/bassist Evan Seinfeld, when we get to discussing the album exclusively for these notes. ï¿½Left to their own devices, children don&#39t see colour or religion or political affiliation or economics and they don&#39t care. On the sleeve, the kids are so innocent, they&#39re playing on a chalk outline of a murder scene completely unaware, and if you look closely, you&#39ll see the kid at the back has picked up the gun and to him its just a toy. You&#39re the one dealing with people being shot and killed today,ï¿½ says Evan, ï¿½Nobody I know got killed today and that&#39s a good day. Every day that happens is a blessing, but just open a newspaper or turn on the TVï¿½ï¿½  So <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> is a hard, streetwise album but that is merely a reflection of the hard streets that <strong>Biohazard</strong> walked. ï¿½<strong>Biohazard</strong> saved our lives in many ways,ï¿½ Evan admits. ï¿½We were all at the end of our lines in these dark, dismal places and than when we formed the band, I wasn&#39t Evan from Canarsie, Brooklyn any more, I was Evan from <strong>Biohazard</strong>.ï¿½  ï¿½But it wasn&#39t until <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> that we got out and saw the world,ï¿½ he adds. ï¿½So that album was basically about the urban struggle and growing up in a city in 1992. And it&#39s kinda timeless in a way &#39cos the songs mean more than ever today. There&#39s a real dark side to the album, but there&#39s also a unity and a powerful, hopeful side to it too.&quot  Indeed, each song on <u>Urban Discipline</u> has its own unique strength and a refusal to bow down or be beaten.  For each dark moment like ï¿½Tears Of Bloodï¿½ or ï¿½Loss,ï¿½ there is a glimmer of light, none brighter than the title track itself.  ï¿½The reason we put songs on albums, at least back then,ï¿½ smiles Evan ï¿½was to share a message and use it as a therapeutic way of getting rid of the angst we were living with at the time, and still dance to itï¿½  And among the many classic hardcore tracks on this album is ï¿½Black And White And Red All Over,ï¿½ the song that put an end to the frankly ridiculous rumors that <strong>Biohazard</strong> were racists.  ï¿½Well it was fucking hilarious to us that were rumors about us,ï¿½ laughs Evan ruefully. ï¿½We like to ride the controversial edge, but anyone who knows our nationalities, religions or political affiliations - they would never even have considered the idea I mean, how about the fact that Danny (Schuler ï¿½ drums) and I are Jewish? It&#39s a bit of a giveaway that I&#39m not a Nazi!ï¿½  ï¿½At the time <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> came out,ï¿½ recalls Evan, ï¿½even though we had &#39Howard Beach&#39 on the first album, there weren&#39t a lot of bands looking at political issues and really attacking them in our genre of music. I think we were one of the first bands to offer an awareness and maybe not a solution, but just that we can rise above it on an individual basis. That&#39s how you change the world, with one person, then one more, then another. We just sing about our experiences, our fears, our hopes, our strengths and our weaknesses and I think it&#39s very honest. You don&#39t have to be from Brooklyn to understand it. <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> was an angry time man, an angry time. I don&#39t think the world has changed that much, maybe a little bitï¿½ï¿½  ï¿½But things have changed a lot for us,ï¿½ notes Evan with rightful pride.ï¿½ When we were recording <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u>, <strong>Biohazard</strong> was still just an idea and now it&#39s something we do full time, it&#39s our lives.ï¿½  It&#39s kind of hard to imagine <strong>Biohazard</strong> working day jobs, but back then Evan was delivering building materials, Danny was working in a stockroom, Billy (Graziadei -vocals/guitar) was driving a truck and Christ only knows what then-guitarist Bobby Hambel was doing.  ï¿½We recorded <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> pretty fast with a guy named Wharton Tiers at Fun City Studios on the East Side,ï¿½ remembers Evan fondly. ï¿½It was so <strong>Biohazard</strong>, like, the drums were recorded in the bathroom and the vocals were done in the kitchen with no lights and all the dirty dishes in the sink that looked like they&#39d been there for five years. Everything was home-made, which is kinda how <strong>Biohazard</strong> is and it was definitely a great time.ï¿½  In 1992, no one could have known what a huge effect <strong>Biohazard</strong> would have on the music world, eventually going on to influence the likes of Prodigy, while all the time retaining their underground roots, and of course, massive, ever-loyal worldwide following. In 1998 they are justly proud of their achievement and of this stepping stone album.  ï¿½I would have to say that <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> is the definitive <strong>Biohazard</strong> album,ï¿½ considers Evan. ï¿½It embodied a very powerful balance of raw unbridled energy, band focus and our diverse musical tastes. The album goes through all the flavors that are <strong>Biohazard</strong> and sets the stage for what&#39s to come with <u>STATE OF THE WORLD ADDRESS</u>, <u>MATA LEAO</u> and even the album we&#39re working on right now. It&#39s great to be able to go back and look at what you did with hindsight, but the important thing is that this is an album we&#39re very proud of and if you really want to know about the album, stop reading this and put it on.ï¿½   You heard the man.

(60, 'Black Label Society', '                             &ampquotI dig working,&quot says Zakk Wylde. &ampquotYou can bitch and moan sometimes about having too much on your plate, but it&#39s gotta get done, and this is what I do.&quot <br /><br />It&#39s a good thing Zakk likes to work, because he may well be one of the hardest-working men in music right now. On top of helping Ozzy Osbourne write songs for his next record, he&#39s just putting the finishing touches on <em>Shot To Hell</em>, his first <strong>Black Label Society</strong> album for <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>. Produced by Zakk and Michael Beinhorn (Ozzy, Korn, Soundgarden), and recorded with longtime pals Craig Nunenmacher (drums) and John &ampquotJ.D.&quot DeServio (bass), <em>Shot To Hell</em> takes the ferocious hard rock of such <strong>BLS</strong> albums as 2003&#39s Blessed Hellride and 2005&#39s <em>Mafia</em> to a whole new level of &ampquotbrewtality.&quot<br /><br />&ampquotI never run out of ideas,&quot Zakk says. &ampquotWe just came in here and started knocking it out. That&#39s how you make records.&quot That take-no-prisoners attitude is all over such snarling tracks as &ampquotConcrete Jungle,&quot &ampquotBlood Is Thicker Than Water&quot and &ampquotGive Yourself To Me,&quot while reflective ballads like &ampquotLead Me To Your Door&quot and &ampquotSick Of It All&quot mix moody melodies with screaming guitar solos. &ampquotIt&#39s a real cool mix of heavy shit and mellow shit,&quot Zakk explains.<br /><br />During the recording of <em>Shot To Hell</em>, Zakk and crew turned Ameraycan Studios in North Hollywood, CA into a cross between a Guitar Center and a teenage boy&#39s bedroom. &ampquotWe had a Mellotron in here, a Hammond B-3, a ton of Marshalls and just about every guitar I own,&quot Zakk recalls. &ampquotIt looked like Sanford and Son out in the parking lot - a whole garage-sale going on with the equipment, you know? And we had pictures taped up on the walls of Randy Rhoads and Jimmy Page, just for inspiration, because you&#39ve still gotta listen to music with a fourteen-year-old&#39s ears. Remembering when you were like, &#39Dude, we&#39re going to see Zeppelin this weekend!&#39- that&#39s what it&#39s all about, man. Because once you lose that, then you shouldn&#39t be doing it anymore.&quot<br /><br />In the two decades since Ozzy plucked him from obscurity (at a gas station job in New Jersey) and hired him to be his new guitarist, Zakk has established himself as a guitar icon on the same level as Rhoads, Page and Eddie Van Halen, thanks to the impressive work he&#39s done with Ozzy, as a solo artist, and as the leader of Pride &amp Glory and <strong>Black Label Society </strong>. He&#39s won practically every guitar magazine award there is, and he&#39s regularly cited as a major influence by the latest wave of metal guitarists. For Zakk, such recognition is humbling and gratifying, especially since he and his late pal Dimebag Darrell were about the only guitarists still flying the flag for seriously shredding solos during the nu-metal Nineties. <br /><br />&ampquotMe and Dime would always say to each other, &#39Are we the only two assholes who can still get from low E to high E and back safely? Does anyone even practice scales anymore?&#39&quot Zakk says with a laugh. &ampquotBut if what I do inspires some kid to pick up a guitar and jam, that&#39s the shit, without a doubt. You can always get better, though that&#39s how I look at it. You never turn your back on practicing - that&#39s what got you where you&#39re at. You could be the heavyweight champion of the world, but you&#39ve still gotta train, you&#39ve still gotta focus on what got you there. When you lose sight of that, then everything just falls to shit. I&#39ll tell ya, brother, I talk to God every day, and thank him for everything I&#39ve got.&quot<br /><br />Indeed, Zakk has plenty to be thankful for. Despite his gruff exterior and rowdy reputation, he&#39s a devoted family man who&#39s still married to Barbaranne, his high school sweetheart, and who dotes lovingly on his three children and his seven dogs. <br /><br />&ampquotPeople say, &#39Zakk, you must get a lot of chicks,&#39 and I always laugh,&quot he reflects. &ampquotWhen you&#39ve got filet mignon at the house, why would you go to McDonald&#39s? I mean, I&#39ve got buddies with chicks in every town, but I&#39d rather just go to a pub and relax, talk to the bartender and solve the problems of the world. This business is like being in an insane asylum, and you need time to relax and get away from it all. What works for me is being with my family, drinking a beer, hanging out, and lifting weights.&quot <br /><br />The summer of 2006 figures to be a busy one for Zakk. Not only will <strong>Black Label Society</strong> be headlining the Second Stage at Ozzfest, but he&#39ll be playing guitar for Ozzy&#39s selected Ozzfest appearances. &ampquotOzzy&#39s scheduled to do about ten shows,&quot he says, &ampquotbut I know him - if he&#39s having a good time, and his voice feels fine, he&#39s gonna wanna keep doing more. I&#39ve got no problem with that, because I love playing with him.&quot <br /><br /><strong>Black Label</strong>&#39s Ozzfest appearances are certain to draw a large contingent of what Zakk terms &ampquotThe Brotherhood&quot - <strong>Black Label</strong>&#39s network of diehard fans, who sport their <strong>BLS</strong> &ampquotcolors&quot and local chapter affiliations at every show. &ampquotIt&#39s just like one big family,&quot Zakk says. &ampquotThe beauty of it is that it&#39s bigger than me, it&#39s bigger than the band. It&#39s become a lifestyle - just like how Harley-Davidson is more than a motorcycle. All the chapters come down to the shows we all hang out and take the piss out of each other - the Boston chapter roaches my ass all the time, because they know I&#39m a Yankee guy. And whenever we&#39re near a big city on Ozzfest, we&#39ll check and see if there&#39s a baseball game happening that night, and we&#39ll round up our troops from the local chapter and hit a game.&quot<br /><br />Zakk&#39s a major sports fan, and an ardent supporter of the Yankees, New York Giants, New York Knicks and New Jersey Devils. Baseball legend Mike Piazza is the godfather of Zakk&#39s son, Hendrix, and Zakk has had the honor of playing the National Anthem at Dodger Stadium, Shea Stadium, Staples Center and Madison Square Garden. &ampquotWhenever I play it, the home team always wins,&quot Zakk laughs. &ampquotIf I can keep my streak up, I won&#39t have to perform live anymore - I&#39ll just hire myself out to play the National Anthem. The phone&#39s definitely gonna get busy around playoff time!&quot<br /><br />Happily for fans of gut-busting, ear-blasting, engine-revving rock and roll, Zakk won&#39t be retiring from performing or recording any time soon. If <em>Shot To Hell</em> is any indication, <strong>Black Label Society</strong> still has plenty of juice left in the bottle.', 2006, NULL),

In Jan.2000,  the band enjoyed the #1 spot on Mexico&rsquo;s largest commercial station Radioactiva for three weeks.  <br><br>BRUJERIA&rsquo;s success runs contrary to convention in the recording industry: they sold almost 25,000 records (Matando Gueros) worldwide in spite of their refusal to: <br><br>a)Tour, <br>b)Use real names, <br>c)Take photos (without masking their identities), <br>d)Do interviews.  <br><br>Many thought they had disappeared forever after Raza Odiada.

It&#39s the most personal song I&#39ve ever written, and I got it out of my system,&quot Hunter says, admitting he envisions kids listening to the song on headphones, to fully absorb it.<br /><br />Hunter continues, saying, &quotThe lyrics are really personal, and fans looking for a &#39Fuck you,&#39 or a &#39Power Trip&#39 type song will be disappointed. This is more thought-out, more realistic. I thought it was time to be upfront in my lyrics and strip away the ambiguity.&quot That makes the lyrics a perfect complement to the music, which directly connects like a series of punches to the groin. <br /><br />When <strong>Chimaira</strong> commenced the writing process, they were coming off a marathon, two-year road trek in support of their most successful album, <em>The Impossibility Of Reason</em>. They had toured as headliners, with Lamb Of God, as well as with <em>Ozzfest</em> 2003, <em>Jagermeister</em> Spring 2004, which featured Slipknot and Fear Factory, and co-headlined the Summer 2004 <em>Road Rage</em> tour with Machine Head. The played a spate of European festivals and clocked 330 shows in 21 countries. &quotWe were eager to write new material,&quot says Hunter. &quotWhile we were touring, we didn&#39t think there would be pressure. We thought it would be a breeze. But when we sat down to do it, we were like deer in the headlights. It took a month of toying with ideas.&quot They joined up with Ben Schigel for the second time, recording at Spider Studios.<br /><br />On <em>Chimaira</em>, the band refused to write songs that fit any stylistic format. Most of the songs on Chimaira hover at the five-minute and over mark, making it clear that they evolved through a natural progression rather than a preconceived notion. &ldquoWe were trying to not have any restraints. If it was a 1 and a half-minute song and or a 15-minute song, as long as we were happy, that&#39s all that mattered. The songs are as long as necessary, in order to get the point across.&rdquo<br /><br />The band contends that <em>Chimaira</em> is Chimaira at their most musical, and that the solos ripped out by guitarist Rob Arnold are unlike anything on previous records. Hunter&#39s screaming is much more intimidating and Chris Spicuzza&#39s ambient/electronic element has added an additional, yet crucial layer to Chimaira&#39s sound. Hunter says, &quotChris took epic parts and made them more epic. You&#39ll ask yourself, &#39Why does this sound so big?&#39 That&#39s our trick!&quot New drummer Kevin Talley, who cut his teeth in death metal bands Misery Index and Dying Fetus, is more of a brutal, in your face live drummer, and Talley&#39s intensity is omnipresent on the recorded album as much as it is on stage. &quotYou can&#39t deny that the drums are ripping your head off. These sound ferocious,&quot Hunter says.<br /><br />The addition of Talley and <strong>Chimaira</strong>&#39s progression as individuals and a band are what give Chimaira its fresh, invigorated feel. &quotEveryone put their two cents in,&quot Hunter explains. &quotEveryone contributed their flavor and style. So, it&#39s truly a Chimaira record. We&#39re like the three-headed beast - we&#39re disagreeing animals forming into one monster.&quot And what a monster it is.', 2001, NULL),

(67, 'Cradle Of Filth', '                             <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> have become an institution. <br /><br />With 15 years passing since the band&rsquo;s first release, <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> have forged their way as the centrepiece of the extreme metal scene. Of the band&rsquo;s longevity, frontman and original member Dani Filth, who joined the band at the ripe old age of 18, says, &quot;I can get a <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> tattoo and not feel embarrassed,&quot; with his trademark, self-deprecating English wit on full display. <br /><br />Through the years, there have been many critically-acclaimed releases, marathon tour cycles and spurts of controversy, simply because the Grammy-nominated <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> refuse to blend into the nefarious scene which birthed them. <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> welcome raised eyebrows and second looks from those who don&rsquo;t quite &quot;get&quot; what they do. <br /><br />The band opened doors for a scene that is no longer as fringe or sectarian as it once was. They&rsquo;ve taken a sledgehammer and smashed away at new ground. They&rsquo;ve maintained a steady pace, while so many of their peers have imploded, crashed and burned.<br /><br />So, how exactly, has <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> managed to outlast &rsquo;em all and arrive at their latest album, the controversially dark fairy tale, <strong><em>Godspeed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder</em></strong>? Simple. By doing what they&rsquo;ve always done and spiking their sonic punch with ethereal keyboards, bloodcurdling screams, riffs that can make lightning shoot from your bedroom walls and a fictionalised re-imagining of a decidedly troubled historical figure from the late Middle Ages: Gilles de Rais. (More on him in a moment!)<br /><br />&quot;We&rsquo;ve survived [all those black metal] episodes because we were more mature than other people were at the time,&quot; Dani says. &quot;We&rsquo;re not being big headed by saying that. We were English and had a tract of water separating us from other black metal bands. We&rsquo;re still one of few English black metal bands. We have had line up changes that have helped. Our fans understand that. People want to find a chink in the armour regarding line up changes, but it&rsquo;s utter crap! I think we endure because we explore every facet of our art. We were into this aesthetic before forming a band and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a hard thing to do if you are into it. All things that surround the nucleus of the band &ndashthe nucleus being the music&mdashlike our look, lyrics, how we portray ourselves on stage and our artwork, tie in all these dark elements.&quot;<br /><br />Indeed, <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> offers fans a full sensory experience and there are certainly no grey areas in their blend of black metal. It&rsquo;s loud. It&rsquo;s fast. It&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s subversive.   Dani continues, saying, &quot;We never shy away from saying or doing outrageous things, but on the flip side, it&rsquo;s never contrived.&quot;<br /><br />One thing that is outrageous but certainly not contrived is the not-for-the-faint-of-heart concept that <strong><em>Godspeed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder</em></strong> orbits around.  The album is a dark fairytale centering on Gilles de Rais, the French nobleman who carved out his place in history as a brother-in-arms of Joan of Arc, as well as a prolific, sick and twisted serial killer who began his life as a devout, pious man before devolving into full-fledged evil. De Rais, also an alchemist who squandered his vast fortune, was eventually hanged for his crimes against humanity, especially children. This is sensitive material, but <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> handle it with signature aplomb.  Rather than glamorising or glorifying de Rais, the band found an artistic way to explore his story.<br /><br />&quot;Read the lyrics,&quot; Dani encourages. &quot;It would have been so bloody easy to have gone overboard when writing about his crimes, which was really sick stuff. I would not put my daughter in a role on the record&mdashshe does a nursery rhyme and her laughter appears on the album&mdashif we hadn&rsquo;t handled the material with kid gloves. It is a black metal record, after all. But there is no glorification of the crimes. We treat the subject as a dark fairytale. It is fascinating and his story has bewitched many other people. There are at least 15 pieces of work written on him by historians who are as fascinated as we are. We just put it to a soundtrack.&quot; <br /><strong><br />Cradle of Filth</strong> chose to create a another concept album after their stint on 2007&rsquo;s Viva la Bands tour. Dani recalls, &quot;We were fired up and we had the skeletal structures to five or six songs. I knew I wanted to outdo our previous efforts. We had a new drummer and the music we were writing was coming from the excitement of the live setting, which can give you that emotion. The feeling of the music reminded me of when we did Cruelty and the Beast, which was 10 years prior. I was pouring through all the notebooks I had kept from investigations I had done into Elizabeth Bathory, who was the conceptual figure of Cruelty, and Gilles de Rais&rsquo; name cropped up back then. I remember thinking that story would be great to follow up our first concept album, only ten years later, since we didn&rsquo;t want to do two concept albums back to back.&quot;<br /><br />In honour of the tenth anniversary of their first concept album, Dani and his bandmates were more than inspired to revisit that aesthetic territory, which had served them well in the past.  &quot;The music had that same magic as when we were writing Cruelty, and it was very symphonic, as well,&quot; the singer says. &quot;The more I started reading, the more I realised that this story is better than Elizabeth Bathory&rsquo;s. Gilles was such a well-known man in a more well known part of the world. Elizabeth was Eastern European and not a lot of information survived her. With Gilles, we have the trial transcripts of the man who was essentially the bodyguard of Joan of Arc. He was Grand Marshal of France, for God&rsquo;s sake. The more I read, the more the story germinated.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> have long been interested in the occult, as individuals and as a band and that&rsquo;s why the story of de Rais was so appealing a person to set to a soundtrack, Dani explains, saying,  &quot;The fundamental basis of what we do is turning things into dark fairy tales and romanticising them. Every single line of the album is a part of the story. It&rsquo;s not like we have footage of his dungeons, so we are filling in gaps. Some scholars believe he was framed. He was a man of war in a brutal time. I don&rsquot think we could ever embellish the nasty parts to the extent of reality.&quot; In a sense, <strong><em>Godspeed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder</em></strong> is like fan fiction of sorts. <strong>Cradle of Filth </strong>draw their fans and listeners into a story, something that has endeared the band over the years, making the band a &quot;lifestyle&quot; for their dedicated followers. Dani says, &quot;With this record, you can immerse yourself in stories I&rsquo;ve written and the music the band has written and you can also go and investigate and find out more for yourself by reading about the case.&quot; <br /><br />In a way, <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> studies de Rais because &quot;he was a man of extremes who ended up at the gates of hell,&quot; finishes Dani. &quot;He was in love with the whole enigma of Joan of Arc and when she was captured and burned, he saw she was like everyone else and he felt betrayed. Since they had saved France against the English, he got close to God, as close as anyone could at the time. When that was gone, he fell from grace and went the complete opposite way. He was excommunicated and never got into heaven, which back then was the worst thing that could ever happen. He was a marriage of extremes.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> are a marriage of extremes as well, taking a controversial character in history and fusing his story with thunderous, scarred &rsquo;n charred metal on <strong><em>Godpseed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder</em></strong>. <br /><br />', 2004, NULL),

(69, 'Cynic', '                             <p><strong>Cynic</strong> was formed in November of 1987 in Miami, Florida by Paul Masvidal and Sean Reinert . Paul and Sean were elementary school classmates when they first started making music together. After a series of mini-projects and explorations, they decided to seriously seek out other musicians. For junior high, Paul was sent away to boarding school in upstate New York where he found bass player Mark Van Erp. Mark eventually moved to Miami along with his friend Jack Kelly who was added on vocals thus completing the first official Cynic line-up. This early incarnation of <strong>Cynic</strong> was focused on making brutal death metal with primary influences taken from bands such as Venom, Possessed, Slayer, Kreator, Destruction and Dark Angel. It is this lineup that would later be featured on the release of their first, self-titled demo in 1988.</p><p><strong>Cynic</strong> parted ways with Jack in 1988, and Paul took over vocal duties. Jason Gobel (whom they met at a show they performed at) was added on guitar and and in 1989, they cut their second demo, entitled <em>Reflections Of A Dying World</em>, consisting of four songs. All of the songs on this demo were of the speed metal/thrash genre, with even some punk elements incorporated. This lineup soon began touring the south Florida area and bootlegs exist of them as far back as May of 1988. Soon after, Mark was out of the band and Tony Choy was added on bass. In 1990, <strong>Cynic</strong> released their third demo (also self-titled). This helped to gain them a large following throughout southern and central Florida, as well as their constant touring and cameo appearances (opening for national acts) in the South Florida area. This new lineup would remain intact until 1991.</p><p>During this time, the bands&#39 influences were beginning to dramatically change. While they were still listening to contemporaries like Atheist and <strong>Death</strong>, and enticed by the sheer intensity of these extreme forms of music, their musical and creative abilities were growing, and consequently, they began listening to more complex and eclectic forms of music. Classic jazz, bebop and fusion groups such as Mahavishnu Orchestra and Allan Holdsworth began influencing their work. Artists such as Pat Metheny and Frank Zappa, 20th Century classical music and even certain forms of pop were expanding their record collections. This change in technical and creative skill had already made its way into their songs as the band took a great leap forward in musicianship for their second and third demos.</p><p>By the early part of 1991, <strong>Cynic</strong> had evolved into a progressive death metal band, although the band themselves didn&#39t consider themselves to be death metal. The music had the technicality of progressive metal with the brutal vocal qualities of death metal. They cut a fourth and final demo in 1991 (financed by <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>) consisting of three tracks. Two of these tracks would, in a drastically different form, make it onto their debut album. In April of 1991, Paul and Sean played on the groundbreaking <strong>Death</strong> album <em>Human</em> alongside the band&#39s mastermind Chuck Schuldiner and Steve DiGiorgio of Sadus. They described their relationship with Chuck as &quotvery laid-back&quot, and were able to help Chuck with the writing by giving him input, which had been missing on the earlier <strong>Death</strong> records. The result was a classic record, and <strong>Death</strong> even got some MTV airplay for their video &quotLack Of Comprehension&quot. At the same time, Tony Choy was filling in for the late Roger Patterson on Atheist&#39s <em>Unquestionable Presence</em>, also a great album in its own right, and guesting on Pestilence&#39s <em>Testimony of the Ancients</em>. Paul did guitars on Master&#39s <em>On The Eighth Day, God Created Master</em>, and Jason worked with Monstrosity (whom Mark Van Erp joined), playing lead on their <em>Imperial Doom</em> album. All of this guest work helped to enlarge the fan base for <strong>Cynic</strong>, making them, according to <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>, &quot...the most popular underground act to never record an album.&quot</p><p><strong>Cynic</strong> was planning to record their first full-length album on the <strong>Roadrunner</strong> label after recording the<strong> Death</strong> record, but Paul and Sean decided to complete the tour cycle for <strong>Death</strong>&#39s European tour through the rest of 1991. These and other delays were part of what expanded <strong>Cynic</strong>&#39s popularity and also gave them more time to develop their sound. Immediately upon Sean and Paul&#39s return from <strong>Death</strong>&#39s European tour, they scheduled to go into the studio in October of 1992 with Scott Burns to record their debut album , when catastrophe hit. Unfortunately for everyone, Hurricane Andrew destroyed Jason&#39s house along with the band&#39s rehearsal facilities. Their plans to record were put on hold until March of 1993. Incidentally, this also interrupted Chuck Schuldiner&#39s plans for the next Death release, <em>Individual Thought Patterns</em>, for which Sean Reinert was his first choice as drummer. Sean decided to put his energies back into <strong>Cynic</strong>. Chuck hired ex-Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan (whom he met through writer / long-time associate Borivoj Krgin) to fill in. During this time, <strong>Cynic</strong> was working with ex-Viogression vocalist Brian DeNeffe. Also around this time, a track of Cynic&#39s was finally released on CD. &quotUroboric Forms&quot appeared in demo form on the <strong>Roadrunner</strong> compilation <em>At Death&#39s Door II</em> in 1992 with a note that <strong>Cynic</strong>&#39s debut album would be released in May 1993.</p><p>May 1993 came and went and no album appeared. The band mutually parted ways with Tony Choy who went on to become Atheist&#39s full time bass player. Soon after, Chris Kringel joined the band, whom they met through Brian Deneffe (Viogression). Chris played with the band for a while (and eventually with Portal), but logistics and stylistic differences led to Darren Mcfarland (from Atheist) whom went into the studio with the band. When things didn&#39t work out with Darren, <strong>Cynic</strong> were back in Miami with all tracks recorded minus bass. Days after their return, Steve Digorgio was at Morrisound recording <strong>Death</strong>&#39s <em>Individual Thought Patterns</em>. One day in a phone conversation with Paul, Steve passed the phone to Sean Malone who happened to be an employee at Morrisound. Steve learned of his bass playing skills during the <em>Individual</em> recording sessions. After sending his bass demo to <strong>Cynic</strong> and meeting shortly after, he recorded bass tracks at Morrisound Studios (where the band had recorded their previous demos), and they finally mixed the record. September 14, 1993, <em>Focus</em> was finally released. With over two years since their last demo,<em> Focus</em> was a remarkable change from the style of any of their previous material, and quite different from anything else in the music world as well.</p><p>After the release of<em> Focus</em>, <strong>Cynic</strong> went on a European tour supporting <strong>Pestilence</strong>. For their live shows, they added a fifth member, lead singer/growler Tony Teegarden, who had actually sung the death vocals on<em> Focus</em>, (since Paul was in danger of losing his voice at the time). Note: Paul sang the ethereal computer voice for all the live shows. Tony also played keyboards live. Due to his schoolwork, Sean Malone could not tour with the band so Chris Kringel came back and replaced him. The tour was cut short, however, when <strong>Pestilence</strong> disbanded. Returning to the states in January 1994, <strong>Cynic</strong> did a few shows in the Florida area, playing the states for the first time in over two years. Malone&#39s only European appearance with <strong>Cynic</strong> was at their Dynamo Festival appearance in the summer of 1994. Next, <strong>Cynic</strong> toured the States during the summer of 1994 supporting Cannibal Corpse. Their tour stretched over 3 months and covered most of the United States. Malone rejoined the group for this tour. Tony was unable to participate, so they borrowed Dana Cosley (from local Florida band Demonomacy) to do the death vocals and the keyboards. Tony did rejoin the group for a show in West Palm Beach which was the only show to contain all the original<em> Focus</em> members.</p><p>After the tour, <strong>Cynic</strong> began work on a new album. In the early stages of working on their upcoming album, the band parted ways with Sean Malone. Soon after they reunited with bassist Chris Kringel who moved back to Miami and worked with the band to write and record the Portal demos. Sean Malone&#39s split with the band was amicable, however, and has continued to work with Sean R., Paul and Jason to this day. Part of the musical shifts at this time, were the band&#39s decision to add a female vocalist. Aruna Abrams was found through a letter she wrote to the band while a student at Berkeley College of Music. After the band received her audition tape, she was asked to join Cynic. She moved to Miami and worked closely with the band for a year writing and recording what would eventually transform into Portal. Sometime during the fall of 1994, while working on the new album, <strong>Cynic</strong> shifted. New directions and sounds led to a name change. <strong>Cynic</strong> was complete and finished it&#39s work under that name. The band felt urged to rebirth into a new musical concept that was born out of these changes. Portal was born.</p><p>-Compiled by Brian Meloon &amp Jeff Litvak from various sources<br />-Updated by Jeff Litvak &amp Tim Spear</p>', 2004, NULL),
(70, 'Daath', '                             <p>Extreme metal with a purpose, <strong>Daath</strong> is poised to emerge as one of the most exciting new bands of 2007 with its <strong>Roadrunner</strong> debut, <em><strong>The Hinderers</strong></em>. Fusing elements of death, thrash, and black metal with technical virtuosity and a decidedly Atlanta groove, the 13 songs comprising <em><strong>The Hinderers</strong></em> showcase the crushing power of this Georgia six-piece.</p><p><strong>Daath</strong> is a Hebrew word meaning knowledge, referring to a knowledge not regularly attained by the masses. Says keyboardist and conceptualist Mike Kameron, &quotOn a mental level, <strong>Daath</strong> acts as a doorway between instinct and intellect, and in our opinion the struggle between those two aspects of mind is what causes most of the ills in the world.&quot </p><p><strong>Daath</strong> is atypical of extreme metal bands, not just making heavy music to make heavy music. There is a purpose beyond the headbanging. &quotBasically,&quot says guitarist Eyal Levi,&quotWe&#39re exploring the inverted tree of life. It&#39s a Kabalistic concept. There are thirteen points on the tree and each one of the songs is representative of the points. Mike will research the attributes for each one of those points and then we figure out what the theme is and write the lyrics based on that. The music is lots of back and forth... we&#39re not one of those bands that gets together and jams. I&#39ll write, Mike will write and then we&#39ll get together and try to make things happen, but it&#39s definitely a team effort. Everyone has to like what we&#39re doing or we don&#39t do it.&quot<br /><br />Mike adds, &quotThe theme of the album is the sum of all self-defeating views which keep us from rising above the norm. We&#39re all dealing with it and we all have things we&#39ve gotta get through in our lives, which are completely internal in order to improve and move on. We&#39ve all gone through it in this band and this represents where we&#39re at. But we&#39re definitely not a religious band or anything like that - it&#39s about exploration. It&#39s an ongoing process. A struggle. Mainly we&#39re just using the tree of life as a framework for psychological exploration and exploring esoteric themes associated with the tree of life.&quot</p><p>Eyal describes the band&#39s unique sound as versatile. &quotWe all have a lot of influences. I started playing the violin when I was four, and I listened to everything from Gustav Mahler to The Doors to Aphex Twin. I don&#39t think that we&#39re traditional death metal. I would say that we&#39re progressive extreme music. We draw from various styles of extreme music - death, black, doom, whatever... we throw in electronica, we throw in orchestral, we throw in some classic rock. We&#39re definitely not sticking to death metal. We&#39re not limiting it. We&#39re always trying to grow, and we already decided which aspects of our sound we want to emphasize more. Our goal is to add new elements with each record, and hopefully we&#39ll always be doing something that people like.&quot</p><p>The band is pushing the boundaries of traditional death metal. There is a lot of groove to the songs on <strong><em>The Hinderers</em></strong>, notably on &quotSubterfuge,&quot &quotFrom The Blind&quot and &quotOvum.&quot &quotThat&#39s probably just because we&#39re from Atlanta, you know?&quot Eyal laughs. &quotI think that&#39s got a lot to do with it. We like music that grooves, and I think one of the main problems with extreme metal is that there&#39s no real groove to it. That is what keeps it from going to wider audiences. For example, with &#39Subterfuge&#39 I specifically wanted that song to be &#39Atlanta death metal&#39 to bring a crushingly heavy groove that would make people&#39s heads nod, but to also incorporate some very ethereal parts and then a bad-ass solo!&quot </p><p><strong>Daath</strong> was started by Eyal Levi, Mike Kameron and Sean Farber, who have been playing in bands since they were in high school. The three friends attended school at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston. Eventually, the guys left school to concentrate full-time on making music as the project which would become <strong>DAATH</strong> proved far too promising. </p><p><strong><em>The Hinderers</em></strong> was produced by James Murphy (<strong>Disincarnate</strong> ex-<strong>Death</strong>, Testament, <strong>Obituary</strong>) and co-produced by <strong>Daath</strong>. James and Eyal engineered the record with the help of Andy Sneap, while Colin Richardson mixed the album for them. Eyal says on working with the pair, &quotColin and Andy are two dudes that I wanted to work with at some point in time in my music career... taken care of on this album. It just goes without saying what an excellent experience this has been.&quot</p>', 2007, NULL),

DoubleDrive&rsquo;s music is not based on false attitude and ego-driven bluster, rather it is substance unto itself – possessing a sense of both edginess and melody.  Their debut for Roadrunner Records, <u>Blue In The Face</u>, is a bold statement to that effect. “We&rsquo;ve been holding our breath so long waiting for this to happen,” says doubleDrive guitarist Troy McLawhorn, explaining the album&rsquo;s title. Vocalist/guitarist Donnie Hamby believes <u>Blue in the Face</u> accurately sums up the last three years of the band&rsquo;s life. “It&rsquo;s almost like a rite of passage,” he explains. “It covers the ups and the downs, the sweet and the sour and the whole journey that it took to get here. It was a big learning process – you&rsquo;ve got to put a value on sacrifice – but it really paid off.” Bassist Josh Sattler agrees. “Everything happens for a reason, and we&rsquo;re in a much better place now, so it&rsquo;s worth the wait,” he says. “This whole time, we&rsquo;ve been in search of a situation that would put us on the road and let us play for people. To us, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.” As for doubleDrive&rsquo;s own moniker, it could very well refer to the group&rsquo;s relentless determination to see the album released. While the Atlanta quartet was highly visible throughout 1999 and 2000, when the band toured with artists as diverse as Kid Rock, Stereo Mud and Sevendust, doubleDrive has spent much of the last two years under the radar.

They are often credited as the purveyors of the groove-oriented thrash sound later made famous by bands such as Pantera, <strong>Machine Head</strong>, and White Zombie. <p>It has been claimed that <strong>Exhorder</strong> more or less invented the sort of angry, 90&#39s post-thrash metal often attributed to Pantera. It&#39s not really clear who was first (and ultimately it may not matter much), but the resemblance between <em>The Law</em> and Pantera&#39s <em>Cowboys From Hell</em> is clear, with stripped-down rhythm guitars, heavy double-bass drumming, and angry, almost identical vocals complimenting the basic American thrash style of the late 80&#39s. One thing to remember is that <strong>Exhorder</strong>&#39s <em>Get Rude</em> demo, of 1986, has some songs which was released too in their debut <em>Slaughter In The Vatican</em>, making believe that they made their sound before Pantera (because at the same time, Pantera was in their Hair Metal times).

(And when drummer Raymond Herrera was still in high school!) Amazingly, the long-lost <em>Concrete</em> has never been leaked out in bootleg form or proliferated on the Internet, so it is a genuine surprise release.<br /><br />&quotI&#39m very happy about it coming out,&quot beams <strong>Fear Factory </strong>co-founder and guitarist Dino Cazares.&quot It&#39s something special for the kids, who never even heard it. They can see where we were coming from. Back then, we were gigging in East L.A. We didn&#39t really have too much recording under our belts. We had recorded a couple of demos before that, but we had never worked with a producer like Ross Robinson.&quot<br /><br />Recorded in 1991, barely a year after Fear Factory formed, <em>Concrete</em> is important for several reasons. Firstly, it established the band as a viable player in the metal world. While ultimately the group did not want to sign with Robinson&#39s label, <strong>Fear Factory </strong>would use the 16-track release as a way to secure a deal with Roadrunner Records. Producer Ross Robinson, who later sold the album to Roadrunner, would use it as a calling card to produce future stars like Korn and Limp Bizkit. The album also offers a history lesson for people. Vocalist Burton C. Bell brought a melodious style to the death metal world, and influences such as Godflesh and Ministry would propel the band into the industrial and techno realms without losing their core audience.<br /><br />&quotAt the time [of Concrete], all these death metal bands were coming out, and a lot of people were afraid to cross those boundaries,&quot recalls Cazares. &quot<strong>Fear Factory </strong>was a band about taking chances. Not all those chances worked,&amprdquo but at least they pushed the envelope as much as they could. While Fear Factory delved into technological realms, they were not able to do so right from the start. &quotAt the time, we didn&#39t have money to experiment with that,&quot remarks Cazares, but he confirms that the intentions were already there, and they began manifesting themselves on the 1993 release <em>Fear Is The Mindkiller</em>.<br /><br />&quotMe and Ross bumped heads a couple of times on the whole digital thing,&quot recalls Herrera of the <em>Concrete</em> sessions. &ampldquoAs you know by now, Ross isn&#39t very up into the high-tech production stuff. He likes the raw analog stuff, which is cool. I ended up not getting my way [then], but I did later,&amprdquo he remarks with a laugh. Adds Cazares: &quotHonestly, I think <em>Concrete</em> sounded better than <em>Soul Of A New Machine</em>. Ross is really good at capturing the moment.&quot<br /><br />Metal aficionados may find it amusing to learn that <em>Concrete</em> was recorded at Blackie Lawless&#39 studio, where Robinson was then employed as an engineer. &quotIt looked like a cowboy ranch,&quot says Cazares. &quotEverything was all wood. There were cowboy hats, guns, skulls, and cow heads. It was cool.&quot While the band officially recorded drums and vocals during the day, close friends Cazares and Robinson snuck in at night to record guitar and bass tracks, which explains why Dino says the $5,000 album has a $10,000 sound. &quotMaybe someday we can pay back Blackie Lawless,&quot he says with a laugh. &quotI&#39d like to thank him very much for letting us record there! We borrowed some of Blackie&#39s bass equipment to record the bass, without him knowing it. And now he will. Blackie, if you&#39re listening, I&#39m sorry!&quot<br /><br />Eight of <em>Concrete</em>&#39s sixteen tracks were re-recorded for the band&#39s official 1992 <strong>Roadrunner</strong> Records debut <em>Soul Of A New Machine</em>. Four more have never been heard before: &quotSangre De Ninos,&quot &quotDeception,&quot &quotAnxiety,&quot and &quotUlceration&quot. Other songs are presented in their original forms before they mutated into, or became a part of, other songs. &quotConcrete&quot transformed into &quotConcreto&quot as a bonus track on 1998&#39s <em>Obsolete</em>, &quotSoulwomb&quot became &quotSoulwound&quot for that same release, while the instrumental &quotEchoes Of Innocence&quot metamorphosed into &quotA Therapy For Pain&quot for 1995&#39s <em>Demanufacture</em>. Then there is &quotPiss Christ,&quot an entirely different song than the one heard on <em>Demanufacture</em>.<br /><br />Herrera notes of the four unreleased songs that &quotwe never even went back and tried to fix or update them.&quot They represent early, raw <strong>Fear Factory</strong>, pre-sampling and pre-keyboards. &quotThere wasn&#39t a huge budget to do it,&amprdquo the drummer says of the album. &quotWe were all beginners.&quot But he makes no apologies. &quotIt is what it is.&quot<br /><br />Quite simply, Concrete represents the genesis of one of SoCal&#39s biggest metal groups. &quotIt shows where the band came from,&quot affirms Herrera. &quotThis CD is the roots of <strong>Fear Factory</strong>.&quot', 1993, NULL),

Perhaps you also had a world tour mapped out before and after recording, including a run on the 2006 Ozzfest main stage, with just enough time built in to fly your vocalist home to tape episodes of the TV show he hosts - MTV2&#39s HEADBANGERS BALL. Throughout all this, you ran your various business ventures (an indie record label, clothing company, tattoo shop, managing real estate investments and much more) from cell phones wherever you were and called in news updates to various websites that cover your band and the scene to which you have dedicated a great portion of your life. With all this, you might very well be burnt out after 10 years in the spotlight. Jamey Jasta, Sean Martin, Chris Beattie and Matt Byrne - also known as <strong>Hatebreed</strong> with brand new member Frank Novinec - do it all, with a singular focus and hard-earned credibility only dreamt of by many of their contemporaries. <br /><br />&quotI wanted to get in the right head space, to get back to square one, and to why I started expressing myself through music in the first place,&quot says frontman Jamey Jasta about <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, his band&#39s fourth full-length and Roadrunner Records debut. &quotOnce [bassist] Chris [Beattie] and [guitarist] Sean [Martin] started bringing ideas to the table, and I started arranging songs and reading through the lyrics I had compiled, I got excited again. I wanted to feed off that and the feelings that I had on our first record. I wanted to tap into those good feelings and adrenaline and to express and communicate them over the most intense album we&#39ve ever made.&quot Thanks to the visceral, fierce music contained on <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, it appears that the members of <strong>Hatebreed</strong> , who were nominated for a Grammy in 2005, have gotten their &quotinspiration&quot back. <br /><br />On <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, <strong>Hatebreed</strong>, who&#39ve toured with everyone from Slayer to new labelmates<strong> Slipknot</strong>, deftly illustrate all the things that have made them one of the underground heavy metal scene&#39s most beloved and most important bands of the past decade. It also presents a new and improved <strong>Hatebreed</strong>, who took some time, celebrated their ten-year anniversary with a sold-out tour, reconnected with their fans, navigated some personal issues, and then recorded an album that is as hulking as it is tight, as tough as it positive. This Connecticut quintet - rounded out by drummer Matt Byrne and new second guitarist Frank Novinec - is ready to show the world why its throne atop the heavy metal kingdom with <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>is firmly intact. While a &#39positive&#39 <strong>Hatebreed</strong> might seem like a contradiction in terms, since they play aggressive music that sets off carnage-producing moshpits, Jasta pens lyrics that speak of hope, rising above, and believing in yourself. It is precisely those qualities that will allow <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>to connect with the kids on a profound level.<br /><br />&quotYou can&#39t have one without the other,&quot Jasta says about the band&#39s dichotomy of neck-snapping music paired with uplifting lyrics. &quotThat&#39s our niche. It&#39s what we&#39ve done from the beginning.&quot He also says &quotwe wanted to expand on it, without veering too far from what we&#39ve built,&quot when it came to crafting <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>. Jasta admits that he was in a bit of personal slump over the past two years, and that he considered leaving the music business. He was able to break the negative cycle, thanks to two essential things: his redirected focus and his fans. &quotI was becoming disenchanted with the music business, touring and other aspects of being in a band,&quot he admits. He thought long and hard about <strong>Hatebreed</strong>&#39s future, and when it came time to sit down and write <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, he and the boys played with ideas demoing in different studios. <br /><br />The ease and comfort of the process sparked <strong>Hatebreed</strong>&#39s creativity, and as a result, <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong> combines the raw, intense bite of their debut, <strong><em>Satisfaction Is The Death Of Desire</em></strong>, with the tectonic-plate-shifting power of <strong><em>Perseverance</em></strong>, resulting in their best effort to date. Jasta continues, &quotIt was important to show on this record that it&#39s not how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up. I wanted to reconnect with positive energy, and convey that through the music. I wanted to stay on our path, but make it better, more concise, and turn any nonbelievers into believers.&quot<br /><br />Jasta also contends that the main theme on <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, which was produced and mixed by Zeuss at Planet Z in Massachusetts, is overcoming &quotfeelings of depression, guilt, sadness, anxiety, alienation. I wanted to show that there is hope, and you have to start with yourself. You can&#39t help other people if you can&#39t help yourself.&quot Sonically, the band thickens its sound with the addition of Novinec, and <strong>Hatebreed</strong> plays with speeds, textures and explores new vocal terrain on <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>. &quotWe did slow stuff, fast stuff, more double bass,&quot Jasta explains. &quotWe wanted to accentuate the drive, the intensity, and make certain parts heavier. But we also wanted to make sure the message came through.&quot Here, Jasta enters some different vocal registers, previously unheard on <strong>Hatebreed</strong> records although you wont hear any clean guitar or vocal harmonies that&#39s for sure.<br /><br /><strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong> contains the cathartic, cleansing &quotDestroy Everything&quot and the anthemic &quotDefeatist,&quot the chorus of which the <strong>Hatebreed</strong> faithful will scream at the top of their lungs at shows. About that song, Jasta says, &quotIt&#39s like me talking to myself, and talking to people that I don&#39t want to be like. It&#39s about not defeating your purpose or giving into assumptions and doubts. That&#39s something that I never sang about.&quot The thoroughly cathartic &quotTo The Threshold&quot was the focus track on Headbanger&#39s Ball: The Revenge, while the call-to-arms &quotNever Let It Die&quot and &quotHorrors Of Self&quot are songs where Jasta mined his personal life for source material. &quotI started chipping away, changing things I knew weren&#39t working for me,&quot Jasta says, referring to the turnaround that he experienced. &quotI had to mend relationships, cut other relationships off, and get back to why I wanted to be in a band. I had to reignite the spark, so to speak, because I was burnt out.&quot After logging 600 shows in a mere two years, the frontman turned the negative into a positive. &quotI started reading emails, letters, and reopened my PO box which was shut down due to the volume of mail I received,&quot Jasta reveals with candor. &quotI reconnected with fans on our 10-year anniversary tour and talked to the kids, and met with so many people who were motivated and inspired by our words, our songs, and had overcome worse problems than I ever had, so it made me appreciate the power of music again.&quot <br /><br /><strong>Hatebreed</strong>&#39s fans gave back to the band, just like the band gave itself to the fans, showing the redemptive, cyclical power of their music. Ultimately, <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong> is a testament to renewal and reconnecting. It is also the defining statement of one of metal&#39s most important, most &quotsupreme&quot bands.', 2006, NULL),
(92, 'Ill Nino', '                             &quotThe first record is the foundation,&quot says drummer Dave Chavarri. &quotThe second record is where we built the house.&quot It&#39s a rather simple analogy, but it sums up the last two years of <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s career effectively.<br /><br />For <strong>Ill Nino</strong>, first there was <em>Revolution, Revolucion</em>, which introduced the Latin-flavored sextet to the rock world. <strong>Ill Nino </strong>was something new, something different, and something spicy. With their explosive percussive elements and Spanish-guitar undertones, the band lent a much-needed &#39worldly&#39 element to their aggressive rock assault. From the get-go, <strong>Ill Nino </strong>was something new, something different - their first single from <em>Revolution, Revolucion</em>, &quotWhat Comes Around,&quot was added early at K-ROCK New York, and with a video directed by Marcos Siega, the band was off and running. Now there is <em>Confession</em>, the next logical step in the band&#39s burgeoning career. Once <em>Confession</em> hits the streets, there will be no looking back for <strong>Ill Nino</strong>, as they have struck an artful balance between memorable and menacing.<br /><br />In the past two years <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s debut has exceeded 350,000 units worldwide in sales and the band has enjoyed highly successful stints on both the US and European 2002 Ozzfests, the 2002 Jagermeister Tour as well as touring with the likes of P.O.D., Drowning Pool and Static X. But it wasn&#39t all smooth sailing, as the New Jersey group weathered some rather intense storms, including some member changes. Whereas lesser bands might have had a hard time with the adjustment, <strong>Ill Nino </strong>is a better band because of it, with their unique chemistry fully in tact.<br /><br />Ultimately, through <em>Confession</em>, the real <strong>Ill Nino </strong>emerges. The heavily, percussive album is fuelled by the band&#39s patented tropical percussion, soaring riffs, alternate English and Spanish language lyrics, and an appreciation for melody. Regarding its telling, open title, singer Cristian Machado says, the album is &quotabout coming clean with your thoughts, your past experiences, and within yourself. It&#39s about telling the truth, not only to others, but also to yourself.&quot<br /><br />By their own admission, <em>Confession</em> takes <strong>Ill Nino </strong>to the next level. After spending two years on the road in support of <em>Revolution, Revolucion</em>, the band was exhausted, yet extremely motivated, to dive into the writing and recording processes for <em>Confession</em>. The band immediately started writing their new record in January 2003, hit the studio in April, and wrapped up in July, with barely any time off in between their last 2002 tour date and the recording process. It&#39s clear that dedication to its craft is one of <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s strongest qualities. <br /><br />&quotBeing on the road for two years helped the band gel musically and as friends,&quot says <em>Confession</em> co-producer Chavarri. &quotWe were ready to come up with a brand new record that would take us to a new level.&quot Machado finishes, &quotThis is definitely a more defined <strong>Ill Nino </strong>sound.&quot The band is extremely confident that <em>Confession</em> will appeal to all audiences, including heavy metal headbangers and rock radio fans. Machado explains, &quotThe record is heavy and is everything <strong>Ill Nino </strong>fans want to hear.&quot<br /><br />It&#39s also got everything a non <strong>Ill Nino </strong>fan would want to hear in a band: attitude, emotion, and aggression. Not every rock band out there can lay such a claim, but one listen to &quotHow Can I Live&quot deftly illustrates <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s ability to stretch itself across many rock genres without ever spreading itself too thin. <br /><br />During pre-production for <em>Confession</em>, <strong>Ill Nino </strong>parted ways with two members, but was blessed to hook up with former <strong>Machine Head</strong> guitarist Ahrue Luster, who was a friend of the band, to fill the vacant guitar spot, and Danny Couto, who jammed with guitarist Jardel Paisante in his pre-<strong>Ill Nino </strong>days, to fill the percussionist slot. But this departure had an even greater positive effect for both bassist Laz Pina and guitarist Jardel Paisante as it allowed them to grow and expand their position as the backbone of <strong>Ill Nino</strong>. While it might seem frightening to incorporate new members into the band on the eve of a new album, Chavarri admits that the new members &quotbring a new fire, new energy to the band in every aspect. They are the perfect fit for <strong>Ill Nino</strong>.&quot<br /><br /><em>Confession</em> was produced by Bob Marlette (Saliva, Black Sabbath) and is &quoteverything we want it to be, musically and spiritually,&quot reveals Chavarri. The ferocious first single, &quotHow Can I Live,&quot which was also the lead single from the <em>Freddy Vs. Jason</em> soundtrack, burrows its fangs into your memory with its unforgettable melody. &quotTe Amo, I Hate You,&quot says Machado, &quotis about bipolar personalities in everyday life. Sometimes you don&#39t always have the answers and the best decision is no decision. Life always balances itself out somehow.&quot The tense &quotLifeless Life&quot is <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s song about that safe refuge place in life that everyone has where they can run to get away from things bringing them down.<br /><br />With <em>Confession</em>, <strong>Ill Nino </strong>are baring all for their fans. It is a telling and open musical statement from a band that is not afraid to expand the boundaries &ndash both sonically and geographically &ndash of heavy music. The band plans to bring their unique &quotRevolution&quot to even further corners of the world this time around. With an album as fine as <em>Confession</em>, that shouldn&#39t be a problem.', 2001, NULL),

They&#39ve endured censorship, massive lineup changes, infighting, and attacks by religious groups, mass media, government and right wing thugs.

Their 1988 move to Florida set the stage for the recording of their second demo which pressed 1000 copies, establishing them as legitimate contenders in the field. On this second demo, Malevolent Creation used a new drummer and also addd John Rubin on guitar. The next year saw another drummer change with Mark Simpson taking position at the skins.

Watching footage of the <strong>New York Dolls</strong> onstage two years ago at the behest of one of their biggest fans (who was curating the prestigious Meltdown Festival in London) one realized just how vast - and heretofore unsung - their influence truly was. Everyone knows the famous logo: chrome lipstick, scrawling that name across an unseen mirror, but it&#39s more than the great brand. It&#39s not about the androgyny either. Skinny boys were wearing make up long before them. Little Richard. Elvis. It&#39s not even about the music, as the Dolls themselves were always quick to credit 50&#39s R&ampB numbers or early 60&#39s girl group productions as their own influences. Really, what makes the Dolls so eternal is the attitude - it got into rock&#39s water supply and never left. Kiss, Aerosmith, The Ramones, Blondie, The Sex Pistols, The Damned, Motley Crue, Guns &#39N&#39 Roses, Hanoi Rocks, The Strokes, The Libertines and just about any gang of strutting rockers who are convinced that their band could take your band and possibly your whole town in a pretty for pretty, ugly for ugly throwdown. <strong>New York Dolls</strong> and their disciples win, not just with brawn but with what guitarist Sylvain Sylvain calls &quotplenty of intellect and plenty of sex.&quot <br /><br /><strong>The New York Dolls </strong>are, simply, the Beatles of attitude. Thirty five years into their existence (thirty one since they disbanded down in Florida in a haze of smack withdrawal and managerial anarchy), with three men down, they can still take your band, pretty for pretty, ugly for ugly, onstage, and now, with the long (long) awaited follow up to 1974&#39s awesome Too Much, Too Soon, on CD too. <br /><br />&quotYou know how England is,&quot David Johansen quips in his Staten Island drawl, thick as South Ferry sludge, &quotWe made a big noise over there, and we were having so much fun, we decided to keep going.&quot &quotThe phone didn&#39t stop ringing,&quot Sylvain adds, &quotThe kids wanted this. Kids of all ages.&quot An album&#39s worth of brand new <strong>New York Dolls </strong>compositions, as unlikely as it may have seemed in 2003, was a foregone conclusion after wildly successful festival and live dates that spanned the past two years. They were a reunion when they re-started. Now, with replacement members feeling comfortable stepping into the stack heels of departed legends like Johnny Thunders, Jerry Nolan, and most recently Arthur &quotKiller&quot Kane, they&#39re a gang once more. &quotIt won&#39t be very long that we&#39ll be together longer than the original band was,&quot Johansen laughs. <br /><br />And so we have official studio release #3,<strong><em> ONE DAY IT WILL PLEASE US TO REMEMBER EVEN THIS</em></strong>, where the <strong>New York Dolls&#39</strong> hallmarks: perfectly mean riffs, deceptively sweet choruses and miles of that infamous attitude meet the 21st Century. What&#39s the same? &quotI think it&#39s still an up kind of thing,&quot Johansen says describing that quality that makes the <strong>Dolls</strong>, whatever, whomever and whenever, unmistakably <strong>&quot</strong>the <strong>Dolls.</strong>&quot &quotIt&#39s got a non-defeatist philosophy and attitude. It says <em>We can do anything</em>.&quot<br /><br />What&#39s different? Well, listen to a track like the harmonica driven mid-tempo ballad &quotI Ain&#39t Got Nothing,&quot and it&#39s clear that you&#39re also dealing with real survivors. &quotWe are older,&quot Sylvain acknowledges. &quotBut we share the same spirit as when we were fucking 18.&quot They wear it well too. The world-weariness isn&#39t depressive, but rather philosophical - glamorous even. Think mid-period Sinatra (if he&#39d hailed from the Bronx and not Hoboken) or Leonard Cohen (if he were less Canadian). &quotIt&#39s a statement of where we&#39re at in life,&quot Johansen says, &quotLife gets better as it goes along and you&#39re more aware of the totality of the thing. When you&#39re a kid, you can - at least I could - block out the not so happy happy, party party aspects of it. Do I feel like a survivor? Yeah.&quot <br /><br /><strong>The New York Dolls </strong>don&#39t stare into their whiskey glasses too long. The up-tempo, Motown-flavored single &quotDance Like A Monkey&quot would likely inspire heated debate on intelligent design vs. evolution if its tribal rhythm didn&#39t unite believers and pagans out on the dance floor. It should quickly enter the pantheon of great simian songs in rock history. Tracks like &quotGimme Love and Turn On the Light,&quot all blues and garage rock horniness serve to remind (if anyone&#39s forgotten) the &quotsex&quot that is brought to the fore, nudging the &quotintellect&quot back a bit. Iggy Pop&#39s backing vocals punctuate the statement. &quotThere&#39s an attitude we have towards rock n&#39 roll that&#39s kind of fierce,&quot Johansen explains, &quotThere&#39s something in this band where we really want to swing and swing hard.&quot<br /><br />Radio never really &#39got&#39 the <strong>&#39Dolls</strong> in their first time &#39round, and although they were made for MTV, their own timing was off with that phenomenon. Their first two records are in every cool kid&#39s collection today (as they must be) and from &quotLonely Planet Boy&quot off the first record to <em>Too Much Too Soon&#39s </em>&quotHuman Being&quot (not to mention Johnny Thunders&#39 indelible &quotYou Can&#39t Put Your Arms Around a Memory,&quot which the <strong>Dolls</strong> still play live), the guys always had a way with a timeless pop melody. <strong><span><em>One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This</em></span></strong> continues this tradition. &quotTake A Good Look At My Good Looks,&quot is perfectly realized retro-romantic pop. &quotOur producer heard it and said, &#39Syl you still have one foot in the Brill Building&#39,&quot Sylvain laughs. <br /><br />&quotDancing on the Lip of A Volcano,&quot featuring backing vocals from Michael Stipe and a shimmering hook, is easily as catchy as any new pop written by Swedes and not recorded by rock legends. &quotWe thought, &#39Michael Stipe would be great on this,&quot Sylvain explains. &quotAnd so we called him. I live in Georgia and met him at a Patti Smith show. He said to me that he had seen David and I perform and that I handed him a bottle of Perrier. We heard his voice on the track and it was like &#39man this belonged on there all the time.&quot Stipe is one of only a few guests, whose impact on the tracks are subtle. &quotWe got good stuff,&quot Johansen says, &quotWe&#39re a good band. We can do what we gotta do for better or for worse. I didn&#39t feel like we need this, or we need that.&quot <br /><br />Although recorded, mostly live, with producer Jack Douglas (who was an engineer on their self-titled debut, and produced classic albums for Aerosmith, Cheap Trick and John Lennon), this is a cleaner sounding <strong>Dolls</strong>. The rawness is there in the aforementioned attitude, but nobody is pretending Nixon is still in office either. &quotYou can never be amateurish again,&quot Johansen explains, &quotThose two Dolls albums are like folk art. Urban folk art. Alan Lomax could have made them. They captured some Grandma Moses thing. We were so young and new at playing. When I was considering how to go about writing, I was saying, as you go through life and get more skilled at your craft, you can never go back.&quot<br /><br />And so we move forward. &quotThis is phase two,&quot Johansen says. &quotIt&#39s a new band. A whole new thing.&quot Purist fans may scoff that it&#39s not the <strong>New York Dolls</strong> without Johnny, Jerry and Arthur, but both Johansen and Sylvain insist that bassist Sammi Yaffa, guitarist Steve Conte, keyboardist Brian Koonin and drummer Brian Delaney are indeed Dolls now. &quotWe didn&#39t set out to replace anyone,&quot Sylvain reminds us. We&#39re talking about the deceased here, not the dismissed, after all. &quotThey&#39re great guys,&quot Johansen assures those who may be in doubt, &quotThey&#39re part of every aspect of everything. That&#39s what being in a band is all about. I&#39ve got them all psychoanalyzed. Very interesting subjects.&quot <br /><br />Is the world really ready for the <strong>New York Dolls</strong>? &quotI don&#39t care if this record is a hit,&quot Sylvain assures, &quotJust as long as every man, woman and child buys it.&quot<br /><br />- Marc Spitz', 2006, NULL),

The band had been on indefinite hiatus since 1997 and by the middle of 2002 playing together again was the furthest thing on their minds. Singer John Tardy was working at a computer company, guitarist Trevor Peres was in Catastrophic, guitarist Allen West was in Lowbrow, bassist Frank Watkins was hawking mortgages, and drummer Donald Tardy was playing live with Andrew WK. Then, before an Ozzfest gig in West Palm Beach, Andrew WK called John and Frank and invited them to play a few songs onstage with him.<br>  <br>&quot;We hooked up to practice a couple songs and we remembered how fun it was to play together,&quot; John says. &quot;That&rsquo;s all it took. We ended up doing a couple shows that were really well received, and things just snowballed from there.&quot;<br>  <br>In early 2004, Obituary finally decided to start working on their sixth studio record. Often, when bands haven&rsquo;t been together for years, writing sessions are initially strained or unproductive and it takes a while for the musicians to get back on their creative feet. Obituary had no such problem.<br>  <br>&quot;It was really like putting on an old pair of shoes,&quot; John says. &quot;It didn&rsquo;t seem like it had been six years at all, it was more like the blink of an eye. Some of us had longer beards than we used to have but everything felt the same. After about five minutes together, we were totally back at 100 percent.&quot;<br>  <br>One listen to the band&rsquo;s new album, <i>Frozen In Time</i>, and it&rsquo;s clear that Obituary have returned with the same force and fortitude they had in the early &rsquo;90s. &quot;On the Floor&quot; opens with an incisive, churning riff, thunderous beats and bloodcurdling vocals before shifting into a chugging, bone-splintering breakdown, &quot;Blindsided&quot; rides a gradually ascending hate groove to a destination just south of Hell, and &quot;Back Inside&quot; fuses colossal crunch with pummeling double-bass drumming to create a deadly mosh pit firestorm.<br>  <br>&quot;When I sit and listen to it, I hear some songs that sound like they might have come off of our <i>Slowly We Rot</i> record and others that sound like they might have come off of <i>World Demise</i>,&quot; John says. &quot;Then there are others that are unique to us and different than what we&rsquo;ve done in the past. So it&rsquo;s really well rounded, and at the same time, it&rsquo;s the heaviest thing we&rsquo;ve ever done.&quot;<br>  <br>Obituary spent three months writing the album and practiced the songs until they could play them blindfolded. Then, they took a trip down memory lane, coaxing veteran metal producer Scott Burns out of retirement and working with him at their old stomping ground, Morrisound studios in Tampa, Florida. They also worked with producer Mark Prator at his Tampa ProTools Studio, Red Room Recorders.<br>  <br>&quot;That was incredible because we&rsquo;ve watched Mark grow up through the years,&quot; John says. &quot;On our second record, he was emptying garbage cans at the studio, and now he has his own studio. And being back with Scott was amazing. We&rsquo;ve known him so long and he has an instinct for what Obituary should sound like.&quot;<br>  <br>From start to finish, <i>Frozen In Time</i> was created without any major trauma or turbulence. In fact, one of the biggest challenges for Obituary happened after they finished in the studio and were trying to come up with a name for the record. They considered titling it after one of the album tracks, but decided that no single cut could adequately represent the album. They thought about naming it something that would reference to their reunification after seven long years. Finally, they decided they were best off with <i>Frozen In Time</i>.<br><br>“After six years of inactivity, it&rsquo;s like we awakened out of hibernation just as heavy as we were before. It was like our sound was frozen in time, ” John says.  “This album isn&rsquo;t a new beginning, it&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;ve always done - just newer and better.”', 2001, NULL),

So while recording their third album <em>Testimony Of The Ancients</em> (1991), they enlisted bassist Tony Choy, who at the time was playing with the technical death metal band <strong>Cynic</strong> and Patrick Mameli took over the vocal duties. With this lineup, they released the album <em>Testimony Of The Ancients</em>. The new material was not as abrasive as the previous albums, but the band&#39s musicianship has obviously grown and the album had the best production job of the band&#39s catalogue.</p><p>However, Tony Choy was never a permanent member, and ended up going back to Florida to eventually play with Atheist. In the meantime, <strong>Pestilence</strong> enlisted the talents of Jeroen Paul Thesseling.</p><p>Over the years, the <strong>Pestilence</strong> members were getting into other forms of music, primarily jazz-fusion which, the band wanted to pair with metal. The band&#39s fourth and final album, <em>Spheres</em> was released in 1993. With every album, <strong>Pestilence</strong> went through some kind of a change and <em>Spheres</em> was no exception. <strong>Pestilence</strong> mixed jazz-fusion elements into their death metal style, and used guitar synths throughout the album.</p><p><strong>Pestilence&#39</strong>s popularity had risen with the release of each album, but unfortunately, so did tensions between the members. So after a short period of time, the band unanimously decided to split up, feeling they had reached their creative climax.</p><p>In 1994, <strong>Roadrunner</strong> released one last CD from <strong>Pestilence</strong>: a best-of titled <em>Mind Reflections</em>, containing tracks from all four albums, plus the extremely rare song &quotHatred Within&quot (originally released on the <em>Teutonic Invasion Part II</em> compilation) and six unreleased live tracks recorded in at the Dynamo Open Air Festival in 1992. </p><p>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pestilence_%28band%29)</p>', 2003, NULL),

On the group&rsquo;s first two albums, 1973&rsquo;s Montrose and 1974&rsquo;s Paper Money, Hagar&rsquo;s fiery vocals and nascent songwriting skills were well-suited to Montrose&rsquo;s inventive guitar work.&nbsp Sammy was now on the national stage. His solo records over the next 10 years are remembered for hits like &ldquoI Can&rsquot Drive 55,&rdquo &ldquoOne Way To Rock,&rdquo &ldquoI&rsquoll Fall In Love Again,&rdquo &ldquoHeavy Metal,&rdquo and super soundtrack songs including &ldquoFast Times at Ridgemont High&rdquo and &ldquoThe Girl Gets Around&rdquo from Footloose.&nbsp Hagar&rsquos single &ldquo55&rdquo sealed his status as a solo star. Three Lock Box, VOA and Standing Hampton were three hard rocking albums.&nbsp His &lsquo70&rsquos anthem &ldquoRed&rdquo has followed him through the years giving him his nickname &ldquoThe Red Rocker&rdquo and given his fans their own identity as the &ldquoRedheads.&rdquo<br /><br />In 1985, he surprised fans and industry observers by accepting an offer to join Van Halen.&nbsp Hagar would remain Van Halen&rsquo;s frontman for the next decade.&nbsp During that period, all Van Halen studio albums, 5150, OU812, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, and Balance, shot straight to #1 on the Billboard charts. Live: Right Here, Right Now peaked at #5 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge won a GRAMMY Award for &ldquoBest Hard Rock Performance with Vocal&rdquo in 1991.&nbsp In 2004 Hagar rejoined Van Halen for a reunion tour that wowed audiences across America. <br /><br />In the interim, Sammy formed The Wabos, the band he plays with to this day.&nbsp With The Wabos, he produced more great CDs and more great concerts.&nbsp Hagar continued to invent numerous ways to live the fun-filled party and music-centered life.&nbsp His most recent Birthday Bash celebration was anything but usual at his Cabo Wabo Cantina in the sunny climes of Cabo San Lucas.&nbsp A few thousand fans and some friends including Kenny Chesney, Chad Kroeger from Nickelback, fellow Van Halen-ite Michael Anthony, Jerry Cantrell from Alice in Chains, Chad Smith from the Chili Peppers, Billy Duffy from The Cult, as well as Ted Nugent and Toby Keith joined in the fun.<br />&nbsp<br />Hagar has further shown his entrepreneurial talents as he owns and markets one of the world&rsquos finest tequilas &ndash Cabo Wabo. Introduced into the US in the late 1990&rsquos, Cabo Wabo tequila has become one of the fastest growing and most sought after brands in the distilled spirits industry.&nbsp The tequila is currently one of the top two selling ultra premium tequilas in the country, with sales growing in double digits for a number of years. Now, Sammy has a new partner, Campari that will take Cabo Wabo Tequila to the global market.&nbsp Always expanding his world, Sammy has just launched Cabo Wabo Radio, an internet station that originates straight from the Cantina in Mexico. You never know what the Red Rocker will do next. But stay tuned.&nbsp <br /><br />Sammy remains one of music&rsquos most beloved personalities, definitely one of the happiest and shows no sign of losing the passion that first inspired him to rock.&nbsp As he told CNN in 2002, &quot;The blues guys&mdashJohn Lee Hooker, Lightnin&rsquo; Hopkins, Muddy Waters and all those guys&mdashthey sang and played until they died.&nbsp They got onstage and played the blues and no one asked them, &rsquo;Hey are you getting too old for this?&rsquo;&nbsp But for some reason people think rock is different.&nbsp Well, it&rsquo;s not.&quot; <br />', 2008, NULL);

First, <strong>Trivium</strong> frontman Matthew K. Heafy saw <strong>Sanctity</strong> and was so blown-away that he helped get them a record deal. Then, <strong>Megadeth</strong>&#39s Dave Mustaine caught <strong>Sanctity</strong>&#39s performance during a show with <strong>DragonForce</strong> and immediately offered them a vaunted spot on the second outing of his <strong>Gigantour</strong> festival. &quotHe came backstage and asked us personally to do the show,&quot drummer Jeremy London recalls. &quotThat was such a huge honor because we all love <strong>Megadeth</strong> and Dave has been one of our idols all of our lives.&quot</p>  <p><br /> It&#39s easy to see why the top names in metal are going to bat for <strong>Sanctity</strong>. <strong><em>Road to Bloodshed</em></strong>, the band&#39s debut, is a blistering blend of technical thrash and old-school metal powered with plenty of attitude and grit. Filled with steely, staccato guitars, trampling beats and roaring vocals, the songs marry complex arrangements and musicianship with granite-heavy grooves and unforgettable hooks. &quotWe all grew up listening to Metallica, <strong>Megadeth</strong>, Slayer and Pantera, and no one&#39s really playing music in that classic thrash style anymore,&quot London says. &quotBut at the same time, we like to write songs that aren&#39t dated and will stand the test of time.&quot</p>  <p><br /> In an increasingly lethargic music scene, <strong><em>Road to Bloodshed</em></strong> is a shot of adrenaline and a bold etching in the pages of metal history. Fan-favorites &quotBeneath The Machine&quot and &quotZeppo&quot feature harsh, tuneful vocals backed by a fast, crunchy guitar rhythm, hammering beats and melodic leads. &quotSeconds&quot starts with singer Jared MacEachern crooning &quotYour life is ending seconds at a time&quot before launching into a violently surging medley of frantic drums and guitar. Then the band goes into &quotBilly Seals,&quot which follows a symphonic intro with an electronic rhythm that has machine-gun ferocity and timeless thrash riffage. &quotEverything we do is a collaborative effort,&quot London explains about how the diverse songs coalesce. &quotUsually [guitarist] Zeff [Childress] will come up with a riff, and then he and I will work the song out a bit. Then Jared will come in and help shape it and give it a dynamic voice.&quot</p>  <p><br /> &quotMost of the vocals require a real aggressive style, but we definitely have our melodic side, too,&quot MacEachern adds. &quotI sang in church choir between the ages of 5 and 13, so I try to put some of that in there as well.&quot One reason <strong>Sanctity</strong> sound so tight and in tune is because Childress and London have been friends since they met in their first grade class. Over the years, they jammed together, then started a band in the seventh grade. Individually, they bounced from band to band playing a variety of styles until they were sophomores in high school. They decided to play together again and make music they were actually proud of. &quotI was in this southern rock band I was really sick of, so Zeff and I decided to start playing metal,&quot recalls London. &quotI was playing bass at the time, and he had me switch to drums.&quot For the next two and a half years, <strong>Sanctity</strong> went through several vocalists and bassists and played numerous local shows. But the turning point came when MacEachern saw one of their gigs at his college. </p>  <p><br /> &quotI was blown away instantly,&quot he says. &quotThey were really exciting to watch and I started really getting into it, so I jumped onstage and did &quotCreeping Death&quot by Metallica with them, and there was this instant connection. Right after the show they said, &#39Hey, we need a singer. Wanna come by practice and try out?&#39 So I dropped out of college and joined the band.&quot<br /> <strong>Sanctity</strong> wrote a batch of songs, self-released a pair of EPs and toured exhaustively, playing 190 shows in 2005 alone. At one of the concerts, they shared a bill with <strong>Trivium</strong> and Fear Factory, and before they went on, they asked the guys in <strong>Trivium</strong> to check them out for some constructive criticism. Fortunately there was little to criticize and <strong>Trivium</strong> were way more than constructive. </p>  <p><br /> &quotWe&#39ve really liked those guys since their first album, so their feedback meant a lot,&quot London says. Heafy recommended us to Monte Conner at <strong>Roadrunner</strong>. Monte gave us a call and we sent him our two EPs and we put a live DVD together.&quot Conner liked what he heard and asked <strong>Sanctity</strong> to write some new songs and record him a high-quality demo. London called Heafy, who turned them on to <strong>Trivium</strong>&#39s producer Jason Suecof.</p>  <p><br /> &quotWe did a big benefit show to raise the money to record the demo,&quot London says. &quot600 people showed up. For the other half of the money, we took a loan out, so we went in with Jason and did &quotZeppo,&quot &quotSeconds&quot and &quotLost to Ego&quot and sent them back to Monte. &quotHe really liked the songs, but he said he wanted to hear more to see where our music was going. We then went back to the studio with Jason to do four more songs.&quot Those tracks, &quotRoad to Bloodshed,&quot &quotOnce Again,&quot &quotBrotherhood Of Destruction&quot and &quotBilly Seals&quot demonstrated real musical growth and proved <strong>Sanctity</strong> could continually deliver the goods. Seeing that, Conner flew out to see them live, then signed them to the label.</p>  <p><br /> With a deal in hand, <strong>Sanctity</strong> returned to Suecof&#39s studio in Sanford, Florida to finish writing their first full album. Along the way, they lost their bassist and re-hired Derek Anderson who had filled in previously, but that&#39s not what locked the band&#39s creative brakes for nearly a month. &quotWe were just working so hard to write songs and were really working against ourselves because we were trying so hard,&quot MacEachern says. &quotSo we took a week off and relaxed and let the music do what it does on its own. And from there everything went really smoothly.&quot With the songs for <strong><em>Road to Bloodshed</em></strong> finally written, <strong>Sanctity</strong> went back into the studio with Suecof in high spirits. &quotIt was so easy and so much fun,&quot London says. &quotJason really brings out the best in everybody. He has a good ear and can hone in on the small things that might need to be changed. I tracked 14 songs in 12 hours and Derek did his bass parts in three hours. The guitars and vocals took a little longer, but in comparison to other bands, we worked really fast and had a great time.&quot &quotIt&#39s our first record and I&#39m super excited about it,&quot says McEachern. &quotBut I&#39m looking ahead and I can&#39t wait to do our second, third and fourth record. I look at this all as the beginning of an amazing process that I&#39ve been waiting for my whole life.&quot</p>  <p><br /> From the acrobatic beats and squealing guitar harmonics of &quotRoad to Bloodshed&quot to the off-time riffing and abrupt bursts of &quotBrotherhood Of Destruction,&quot <strong>Sanctity</strong> have tapped into something equally virulent, vibrant and relevant and created the kind of album that causes chills from the first to the 100th time you listen to it. <strong>Sanctity</strong> may consider bands like <strong>Megadeth</strong>, Slayer, and Metallica to be primary points of influence, but ten years from now, a new generation of bands could easily be getting the same type of inspiration from <strong><em>Road to Bloodshed</em></strong> and the many <strong>Sanctity</strong> offerings to follow.</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>    ', 2007, NULL),
(113, 'Sepultura', '                               <p>December 16, 1996: A day that will live in infamy eternally for <strong>Sepultura</strong> fans.<br /> <br /> That night, following a sold-out performance at London&#39s hallowed Brixton Academy, singer/guitarist Max Cavalera left the band he co-founded more than a decade earlier. While <strong>Sepultura </strong>would continue on without Cavalera, who soon re-emerged with <strong>Soulfly</strong>, his departure marked the end of an era for a legendary, trailblazing group All Music Guide praises as &quotperhaps the most important heavy metal band of the 90s.&quot<br /> <br /> In certain respects, 1996 was the most successful year in <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s storied history. Its sixth album, <em>Roots</em>, earned the group its highest critical praise to date. The band also participated in the inaugural Ozzfest tour, where it performed before the largest American audiences of its career. <br /> <br /> But tensions within the group had been running high ever since the August 1996 death of the teenage son of the band&#39s manager, who was also Cavalera&#39s wife. When the rest of the band -bassist Paulo Jr., lead guitarist Andreas Kisser and drummer Igor Cavalera -approached Max about finding new management just months after the tragedy, he viewed the suggestion as a form of betrayal and severed ties with Sepultura shortly thereafter.<br /> <br /> Luckily for fans, the final concert with <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s most celebrated lineup was recorded, and the resulting double-CD Live at Brixton documents one of the most powerful metal bands of all time. Although it features three covers - Motorhead&#39s &quotOrgasmatron,&quot Titas&#39 &quotPolicia&quot and the Cro-Mags&#39 &quotWe Gotta Know&quot (featuring guest-stars Strife, a hardcore band that served as the tour&#39s opening act) - the album also provides a thorough retrospective of <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s first decade of destruction. <br /> <br /> Included are well-known favorites such as &quotNecromancer,&quot the first song the group ever recorded &quotBiotech Is Godzilla,&quot featuring lyrics written by the Dead Kennedys&#39 Jello Biafra &quotRatamahatta,&quot sung in the band&#39s native Portuguese &quotInner Self,&quot the track for which <strong>Sepultura </strong>shot its first music video and &quotAttitude,&quot which Cavalera dedicates to his late stepson, Dana.<br /> <br /> Because it was recorded during the <em>Roots</em> tour, Live at Brixton - mixed by veteran producer Colin Richardson (Machine Head, Fear Factory) - naturally showcases renditions of many songs from that album. The album also features several tracks from each of the three Sepultura records - <em>Beneath the Remains</em>, <em>Arise</em> and the gold-certified <em>Chaos A.D.</em> - which many metal observers consider to be landmark releases and cornerstones of the genre. <br /> <br /> Although <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s first two albums, <em>Morbid Visions</em> and <em>Schizophrenia</em>, garnered the group much attention in its native Brazil, it wasn&#39t until the 1989 release of <em>Beneath the Remains</em> that the band earned mass worldwide acclaim. Called &quotone of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time&quot by AMG, it led to <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s first international tour. No other Brazilian metal band had ever achieved such success abroad.<br /> <br /> The group re-teamed with <em>Beneath the Remains</em> producer Scott Burns - also well known for his work with extreme acts such as Cannibal Corpse, <strong>Deicide</strong> and <strong>Obituary</strong> - on 1991&#39s <em>Arise</em>. Due to its apocalyptic religious imagery, the controversial music video for the title track was banned by MTV, but the album - praised by CMJ as &quotone of the heaviest albums you&#39re likely to find&quot - still sold more than a million copies worldwide. To support the record, Sepultura toured even more extensively internationally, performing two sold-out stadium concerts in Indonesia and also appearing at Holland&#39s giant Dynamo Open Air festival. <br /> <br /> The success of <em>Arise</em> led Roadrunner to strike a co-distribution deal with Epic Records for the 1993 release of <em>Chaos A.D.</em>, a recording that prompted Rolling Stone to laud the group as &quotthe undisputed leader of the neo-metal pack.&quot Featuring the singles &quotTerritory&quot and &quotRefuse/Resist&quot - both of which are included on Live at Brixton - the album went GOLD furthering Sepultura&#39s reputation as metal pioneers, and saw the band begin to incorporate both political commentary and native Brazilian rhythms into their music for the first time. <br /> <br /> Those rhythms figure even more prominently into <em>Roots</em>, hailed by CDNOW as &quota career high point (that) took metal in a direction few headbangers would dare go.&quot The record&#39s extended percussion passages - as portrayed in the live rendition of &quotEndangered Species&quot - added exciting new elements to the group&#39s still-fierce sound. Ten of the album&#39s 16 tracks were included in <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s Brixton Academy set.<br /> <br /> Nearly six years have passed since Cavalera left Sepultura, but the band&#39s impact on hard music continues to reverberate. The group&#39s influence extends to current heavyweights such as Godsmack, System of a Down and <strong>Slipknot</strong>, while young fans discover Sepultura for the first time with each new release by both Cavalera&#39s Soulfly and Sepultura itself. <br /> <br /> In other words, <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s legacy is ensured. It&#39s now time to go back to the Academy for a history lesson you&#39ll never forget.</p>    ', 1990, NULL),

You know its players, the scenes, every camera movement and casually uttered one-liner by heart. Sometimes, when you dream about it long enough, you can even hear the score floating ethereally through the depths of your consciousness. This imaginary soundtrack may very well come courtesy of Eastern Pennsylvania quintet Sinch. The band has been soundtracking the films in their own heads with a sound informed by the heavy styling of Tool, Alice In Chains, and Nine Inch Nails, while finding it&rsquo;s subtle coloring from sonic pioneers like Radiohead, Bjork, and The Prodigy. Stem describes it simply as “emotional rock...whatever comes to us comes to us in the moment of creation, it&rsquo;s all about the moment.” Imagine a movie that combines the aesthetics of Requiem For A Dream, Fight Club, City of the Lost Children, and American Psycho and you get an inkling of their intentions.', 2002, NULL),
(115, 'Spineshank', '                             It&rsquo;s been over two years since Spineshank released their sophomore album, <u>The Height Of Callousness</u>, but upon hearing <u>Self Destructive Pattern</u> it is clearly evident that it was time well spent.  <u>Self Destructive Pattern</u> is the sound of a band hitting its full creative stride and bringing to fruition all of the possibilities that had thus far only been hinted at. “We realized where we stood in our career,” drummer Tommy Decker explains, “and that we needed to put out a great record and we concentrated on that. We felt it was time to change, and made our sound more of a punk rock type thing. There are fewer loops and less electronics, and we simplified some of that and made a rock &rsquo;n roll record. We wanted to stay true to kids who loved our last record, and we wanted to make stuff we liked.”  While serving those two masters is sometimes impossible, Spineshank manages to improve upon the sound of its past and further assert that they are creating the sound of the future on <u>Self Destructive Pattern</u>.  While many of the songs maintain the aggression of <u>The Height Of Callousness</u>, they also display tremendous growth in both song structure and melody.<br><br><u>The Height Of Callousness</u> enjoyed both radio and video airplay thanks to the singles “Synthetic” & “New Disease”.  It also saw the band touring the world and sharing the stage with <b>Disturbed, Mudvayne, hed PE</b> and <b>Orgy</b> and landed Spineshank on the 2001 <b>Ozzfest</b> Second Stage. It was a grueling year and a half spent on the road and the band was tired and ready to rest.  But there is no rest for the weary and the band headed into the studio with producer GGGarth Richarsdson (Mudvayne, Chevelle, Kittie) only to find that perhaps the road wasn&rsquo;t that bad at all.  It took every collective ounce of blood, sweat, energy, and creativity from their bodies to come up with the tracks that comprise <u>Self Destructive Patterns</u>.  It was a process fraught with stops and starts and trials and tribulations.  Once during the recording, the computer, on which a major portion of the album was saved, crashed. The band thought three months of hard work was lost, but GGGarth managed to save it intact. Guitarist Mike Sarkysian says, “It took us 16 months to make this record. It&rsquo;s like giving birth. Some moments happen quick, and some don&rsquo;t. It takes its toll on you. But we stepped back, and looked at it differently and tried different things, which was exciting and challenging.”  <br><br>“Recording this album was like the equivalent of getting tattoos,” drummer, Tommy Decker quips.  “The artist is working on you for a long time. Then he stops, and sprays the area with the water, and it feels good. Then, when he starts up again, and it&rsquo;s worse than it was and you wish you never took that break.”  From all of the pain though, came inspiration, and <u>Self Destructive Patterns</u> truly benefited from the labor expended to achieve it.  As a whole, the album covers a much more expansive spectrum of sounds and styles. Sarkysian admits that “there are more peaks and valleys, whereas our last record was straight up punching you! There was 37 minutes of kicking your ass. Now, we kick your ass and then let you think it&rsquo;s over and you&rsquo;re getting away, and then we&rsquo;ll just kick your ass again.” In true Darwinian fashion, the fittest, most Spineshank-like songs survived the cut from the 30+ songs the band entered the studio with. <br><br>Singer Jonny Santos also knew that Spineshank had to step up to the plate more now than ever.  “It&rsquo;s another evolution. If you listen to <u>Strictly Diesel</u> and then <u>The Height Of Callousness</u>, it&rsquo;s almost like a totally different band. We had to grow again. We wanted to make an extreme record. We didn&rsquo;t follow any rules. “Violent Mood Swings” is brutal. But then songs like “Forgotten” are almost Nirvana-esque, in that slow, “Rape Me” style. We were like &rsquo;Where did that come from?&rsquo; But it felt good.” A lot of personal issues manifested themselves in Santos&rsquo;s lyrics. “I had such a bumpy road the past couple years,” he reveals. “It has ruined a lot of my personal and social life with people that I thought were close to me. I didn&rsquo;t want to write angry hate songs, because there is enough anger in Spineshank to go around already!” Other subjects broached on the album include having an addictive personality (be it to a drug or a person). Santos and Tommy co-wrote almost all the songs together, and the two really gelled. Santos admits that self-reflection was a major source of inspiration. “A lot of people don&rsquo;t reflect on themselves. When writing songs, it&rsquo;s always about someone else, and you point the finger at them and not at yourself,” Santos admits.  <br><br>Santos finishes, “This is most focused this band has been, ever. Everyone had a different goal on the first two records, which is good. But this time, we knew exactly where we wanted to go, and we had to figure out how to get there. There was a lot of hard rock, and the occasional fight. But I&rsquo;m married to these guys. Right now, it is my favorite record in the world. It&rsquo;s fucking Spineshank. We tapped into something we haven&rsquo;t been able to tap into. We took a lot of risks and chances on this one.”', 1998, NULL),

My vocal range has grown.&quot&nbsp </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>Other tracks like &quotDancing with the Enemy&quot and &quotThe Wax Walls of an Empty Room,&quot capture the band&#39s progress and diversity of talent and influences.&nbsp The band&#39s personality shines through both in the music and the lyrics.&nbsp &quotBoth of those songs, &lsquoDancing with the Enemy&#39 and &lsquoThe Wax Walls of an Empty Room&#39 are truly personal songs to me,&quot illuminates the vocalist.&nbsp &quotA broken relationship between best friends was the inspiration behind &lsquoDancing with the Enemy.&#39 &lsquoThe Wax Walls of an Empty Room&#39 is about a lesson I learned in regard to finding strength and happiness in the midst of suffering.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>From touring the world to performing on the <em>Roadrunner United</em> album and in the once-in-a-lifetime showcase in New York City last year, an event Jordan, the youngest musician asked to participate, describes as &quotsurreal,&quot (a reference to sharing the stage with his heroes from Slipknot, Machine Head, HIM vocalist Ville Valo and others) Still Remains has achieved more than they could have imagined.&nbsp&nbsp It wasn&#39t long after the release of <em>Of Love and Lunacy</em> that the band played the annual New England Metal and Hardcore Festival in Massachusetts and then made their way to Europe where they performed in front of thousands at the U.K.&#39s famed Download Festival in Donington Park.&nbsp &quotUp to that point, Download was the biggest crowd we&#39d ever played in front of,&quot explains T.J.&nbsp During the <em>Of Love and Lunacy</em> support cycle, the band made it back to Europe on three occasions, playing in over twelve countries and headlining sold out shows across the U.K.&nbsp &quotEurope has always been an amazing place for us, particularly the U.K.,&quot continues T.J.&nbsp &quotThe metal fans there just seem to get what we are doing.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>Back in the States, Still Remains has toured relentlessly, performing on select Sounds of the Underground dates as well as on the popular Strhess Tour, where they shared the stage with such diverse acts as Shadows Fall, Poison the Well and Suffocation.&nbsp These performances and experiences left an impression that coalesced into what would become the material for <strong><em>The Serpent</em></strong>.</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>While not completely deviating or alienating, <strong><em>The Serpent</em></strong> showcases the band&#39s growth and potential without losing the foundation they have worked so hard to create.&nbsp &quotOne of the things we loved about working with Steve Evetts is that he really forced us to bring out the best in ourselves,&quot Jordan says.&nbsp &quotIf something wasn&#39t right we did it until it was done right.&nbsp No studio tricks, just hard work until we got it perfect.&nbsp I can&#39t imagine working with another producer.&nbsp He has a way of bringing out raw emotion in us.&nbsp I&#39m still growing and learning who I am personally and musically,&quot he goes on to confess.&nbsp &quotI couldn&#39t be happier with the results of this new record.&nbsp It&#39s been a lot of hard work, but was worth every minute.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>With the recording of <strong><em>The Serpent</em></strong> barely behind them, the band is gearing up for a month long stint on the <strong>Van&#39s Warped Tour</strong>, a jaunt that will take them across the U.S. and put them in front of faces who may just be getting their first taste of aggressive and melodic metal.</p>    ', 2005, NULL),
(117, 'Suffocation', '                             <strong>Suffocation</strong> fused the predominant rhythmic styles of early death metal and grindcore, with complex song structures to start a new subgenre of music, considered brutal death metal by some. <strong>Suffocation</strong> is placed amongst peers such as Immolation, Incantation, and Morpheus (Descends) as being part of a genetic fragment of death metal known as &quotNew York Death Metal&quot, or &quotNYDM&quot for short. The band is also known for having two African American musicians (drummer Mike Smith and guitarist Terrance Hobbs) which is rare in the underground metal scene. The band was formed in 1990 and since then released a couple of highly-regarded releases on&nbsp <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>, as well as their last EP <em>Despise The Sun</em> on a smaller label. Of note is also their debut EP <em>Human Waste</em>, which was the first official release on Relapse Records in 1991. <p>In death metal history, <strong>Suffocation</strong> stands unique for fusing the technical with the percussive, brutal &quotolder&quot styles of death metal. <strong>Suffocation</strong> integrated death metal with the muffled strumming and downstroke rhythms of speed metal while introducing more complex rhythms, a variety of influences, and bizarre, mocking lead guitar.</p><p>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffocation_%28band%29)</p>', 1991, NULL),

Do you find yourself wondering if there&rsquo;s anything left to contribute to the <i>New Wave Of American Heavy Metal</i>?

With a sense of humor blacker than the clothing that the individual band members wear and a profound distaste and disgust for both humanity and political correctness, Type O Negative never changes with the times - the times change with them. Marked by sharp wit and bouts of gloom &rsquo;n depression, Type O Negative continues to reward its listeners with what they have come to love and what they have to expect from the Brooklyn doom squad: A nihilistic world view, anthems of sex and death, and a blinding torch of well-placed hate.
