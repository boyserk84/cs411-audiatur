It sounds crude, we admit. But that&rsquos the thing about these Aussie pub rock rebels. Their music, like new album <strong><em>No Guts. No Glory.</em>,</strong> are perfect soundtracks for drunken debauchery, and &ldquothat&rsquos what we&rsquore here for, mate,&rdquo says rowdy lead guitarist and vocalist <strong>Joel O&rsquoKeeffe</strong>.</p>', 2008, NULL),
(2, 'Baptized in Blood', '                             <p>&ldquoThere&rsquo;s an excitement here you can&rsquo;t get with other bands. We take what we do seriously nail you with modern thrash elements but still pull some fuckin&rsquo; weird shit out of our heads.&rdquo</p><br><p>Baptized In Blood guitarist Josh Torrance doesn&rsquo;t jest.</p><br><p>Influenced by everything from Gothenburg to glam&mdashas long as it&rsquo;s distorted&mdashthis London, Ontario-based five-piece runs the metallic gamut, creating a sound that is technically-inspired yet groove oriented and anthemnic in the same throw. Baptized In Blood are keepers of a sonic singularity that has established them as one of modern metal&rsquo;s most forthright, furious and frenetic heavy music bands to date, an aural prowess and thunderous dominance perfectly encapsulated on the band&rsquo;s sophomore effort/Roadrunner Records debut <em>Baptized In Blood</em>.</p><br><p>A collection of ravenously obliterating yet sonically masterful and provocative tunes,<em>Baptized In Blood </em>assures that while these men may only have just over a half-decade of experience under their belts, those countless hours of rehearsals, refinement and devastating performances (blood, sweat and tears) are never in vain. It prods one to wonder exactly how a band poised to realign the state of Great White metal forms in the first place.</p><br><p>&ldquoBoredom,&rdquo chuckles Fendley, noting how the absence of distraction&mdashnamely one particular sport circa 2004&mdashresulted in a unified commitment to decimate the barriers of metal. &ldquoIt was actually by chance. We were talking at the bar about how we should start a band since there was no hockey that year. Everybody piped up about the parts they wanted to do and it was done. We started writing songs and playing shows.&rdquo</p><br><p>Immediately packing venues thanks to both their unadulterated girth and various foundations in the local scene, Baptized In Blood quickly became a formidable endeavour. Issuing both an independent EP and full-length in expedient succession garnered the band an even stronger fan base, with the quintet&rsquo;s sincerity, hard work and endurance eventually commanding the attention of Roadrunner Records, a home where Baptized In Blood&rsquo;s diversity and devotion has resulted in their explosive eponymous affair.</p><br><p>To that extent, <em>Baptized In Blood</em> finds its namesake outfit striving to offer newfound grace, attitude and attack to metal via the aforementioned spirited enthusiasm and borderline-dichotomous influences. Heavily inspired by diverse aspects of thrash metal, punk and classic rock, <em>Baptized In Blood</em> offers a hard edge bolstered by both communicable melodies and outright pummeling amplitude.</p><br><p>&ldquoThere are the straight-up screamers who take it very seriously and have that tough guy, &rsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna try to kill you&rsquo; atmosphere in their music,&rdquo notes Torrance. &ldquoBut you have the opposite end of the spectrum where bands play the same type of stuff but have the extremely clean singing. We&rsquo;re right in the middle of that. Johl&rsquo;s screaming his ass off the entire time but you hear the melody. It&rsquo;s just as dirty either way though. As for the guitars, we&rsquo;re modern thrash but once again, a bit of glam inspiration infuses that excitement and flare.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoEither way, it&rsquo;s all about the metal,&rdquo Fendley interjects. &ldquoIf I had just raspy vocals the whole time, we&rsquo;d be slotted with thrash but if I was only guttural, we&rsquo;d be death metal. I move between all of that so we can&rsquo;t be pinned down. Baptized In Blood adapts to its surroundings because these songs are for us what we want to hear. We can&rsquo;t be lumped into specific sub-genres because we could write a power ballad and it would still be Baptized.&rdquo</p><br><p>Ensuring their vision was documented to perfection, Baptized In Blood enlisted the assistance of producer/engineer Zeuss (Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Chimaira) for the 15 songs that comprise their inaugural Roadrunner exhibition. Welcoming the band into his Hadley, Massachusetts-based Planet Z Studio, the legendary mastermind set about pulling out Baptized In Blood&rsquo;s inherently guttural crunch, overt vigor and virulence while still allowing their own modus to tear through to the bone.</p><br><p>&ldquoHe really worked us hard,&rdquo groans Torrance wryly while noting how<em> Baptized In Blood</em> benefits from broader dynamics, emotion and comprehensive grit thanks to the collaborative effort. &ldquoIt&rsquo;s more serious overall but it also has a fun vibe to it. It&rsquo;s one of those records that someone just getting into metal would think is awesome get out and party to. At the same time a veteran would do the exact same thing &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s uplifting.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoWe&rsquo;re a metal band working with a legendary hardcore producer,&rdquo adds Fendley enthusiastically. &ldquoThat gave us the inspiration to kick it up a notch. None of us were accepting second best.&rdquo</p><br><p>To that extent, both Fendley and Torrance relate that <em>Baptized In Blood </em>is easily the band&rsquo;s most cohesive work to date, propelled by motivation not only to excel but as Fendley notes, an acute history of personal affairs that drive the album to emotional extremes and in turn, engage the music to become harder, faster and inherently catchier.</p><br><p>&ldquoEverything I sing about, I&rsquo;ve gone through. I&rsquo;ve lived through this and write about what I know, not zombies, murder or anything like that. Everyday life motivates me. A lot of people go through what I have, so I try to keep a positive outlook on life because you alone have the choice of being pissed off or making the best of things. My message is that I&rsquo;ve been there too so maybe I can help you out. We&rsquo;re all in this together. As for this album, it&rsquo;s a step in a darker direction but still trying to keep my head above the clouds relieving stresses we as people are going through and asking questions. It&rsquo;s a battle cry: is anybody with me? Does anybody go through this crap too?&rdquo</p><br><p>Compelled by <em>Baptized In Blood</em>&rsquo;s rabid, ravenous and re-invigorating assault, Fendley&rsquo;s answer will come with resounding affirmation. Not only do we metallions relate to his lyrics but as this incensed, metal masterpiece unfolds, we are congenitally coerced into action. It&rsquo;s a state even Baptized In Blood themselves are unable to avoid.</p><br><p>&ldquoThis album is the result of a lot of hard work,&rdquo declares Fendley. &ldquoWe followed a dream and after six years we&rsquo;re at the starting point to really make this work. This album may be completed...but now it&rsquo;s time for us to really start busting ass.&rdquo</p>', 2010, NULL),

(4, 'Black Stone Cherry', '                             Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans, the new noise rang like a Sunday morning church bell, calling on saints and sinners alike to free their minds and become part of the revolution. They came out of the Southern swamps, the California desert, the working class towns of the Midwest and all along the East Coast.&nbsp Loud guitars and larger than life drumming came together with storytelling poetry.&nbsp Rebel-ism gave birth to rock &lsquon&rsquo roll.<br /><br />Every few years or so, a special batch comes up from the ground, to serve as a beacon.&nbsp <strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong> have arrived with their second Roadrunner Records release, <strong><em>Folklore and Superstition</em></strong>. &nbsp<br /><br />&quot;There is a mystique with folklore and superstition,&quot; says <strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong> drummer John Fred Young. &quot;We&rsquo;re intrigued by and interested in history, roots and heritage, and we incorporate that into our songs.&quot;<br /><br />The ability to tell compelling stories and lyrical tales isn&rsquo;t the only thing that <strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong> bring to the table. <strong><em>Folklore and Superstition</em></strong> isn&rsquo;t just a Southern rock record. It&rsquo;s an American rock n&rsquo roll record.&nbsp The album is a timeless work by American pied pipers destined to take their music from the back roads of America to the four corners of the globe.&nbsp &quot;We are taking Southern tradition and giving a taste to the rest of the world,&quot; says bassist/vocalist Jon Lawhon. <br /><br /><strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong> didn&rsquo;t stray too far away from home to record the album.&nbsp The band wrote all the songs in the infamous Practice House, an old farmhouse used by John Fred&rsquos father and uncle to write Grammy winning albums for The Kentucky Headhunters.&nbsp&nbsp A song like &ldquoSoul Creek&rdquo fills the room with its vintage arena rock sound yet was born where the band held bonfires around a creek across the country road. &nbsp<br /><br />The band enlisted famed rock producer Bob Marlette (Ozzy, Shinedown, Quiet Riot) and headed to Nashville&rsquos Blackbird Studios that has housed everyone from Kid Rock to The Raconteurs, just 85 miles from their hometown of Edmonton, Kentucky.&nbsp &ldquoWe incorporated regional sounds into the mix throughout the album,&rdquo says Young.&nbsp The band used turkey calls, a banjo and a washtub basin, among other things.&nbsp Jon Lawhon recalls, &quot;I made a washtub bass out of a broom handle and nylon rope!&quot;&nbsp Clearly, the band shied away from absolutely nothing when it came time to explore and experiment. &quot;We didn&rsquo;t want to leave any door unopened while recording,&quot; says guitarist/vocalist Ben Wells. <br /><br />Hitting the road in support of their 2006 self-titled debut helped inspire and direct <strong>Black Stone Cherry&rsquo;s</strong> worldview when it came time to write the new album. The band traveled extensively outside the United States during the tour cycle.&nbsp This allowed them to stretch their creative muscle with songs like &quot;Please Come In&quot; and &ldquoSunrise&rdquo which show the band&rsquo;s growth and diversity.<br /><br />&quot;This album has allowed us to dig deep into our roots,&quot; continues Young. &quot;It also shows our influences in the songwriting. Our band is a positive band and we try to write songs that are uplifting. We also have a big storytelling side to us which comes through on songs like &rsquo;Ghost of Floyd Collins&rsquo and &lsquoReverend Wrinkle.&rsquo&quot;<br /><br />Vocalist/guitarist Chris Robertson reflects on the process, saying, &ldquoStarting out as a band seven years ago, with high hopes and even bigger dreams, I honestly believe this record shows the experience of our past travels, and gives a hint of the future. It captures all the energy and heart that embody <strong>Black Stone Cherry</strong>. We took some chances on this album and I believe that our fans will appreciate seeing the other sides of the band that they may or may not have known existed.&rdquo<br /><br />Ben Wells comments on the band&rsquos expansion of its sound and subject matter, saying &quot;The songwriting took on a life of its own, as the structures of the songs themselves have grown so much from touring. We have so much more to talk about and can apply the things we picked up musically.&rdquo He admits the band also kept the ladies in mind this time around, recalling, &ldquoOn the last album, girls would come up to us and say, &rsquo;You have songs for guys, so where are our songs?&rsquo&nbsp So we have a song called &rsquo;You&rsquo; on this album, which is a timeless ballad.&quot;<br /><br />The band&rsquos family and friends are another influence. &quot;Long Sleeves&quot; is told from the viewpoint of a friend who took part in the battle of Mogadishu as featured in the film &ldquoBlack Hawk Down,&rdquo while &quot;Things My Father Said&quot; is a ballad that hits home with people from all walks of life.&nbsp &nbsp<br /><br />From the eerie swagger of &ldquoThe Key&rdquo to the tell tale rocker &ldquoBlind Man&rdquo to the triumphant stomp of the anthem &ldquoSoulcreek,&rdquo to the heartfelt message of &ldquoPeace Is Free,&rdquo Black Stone Cherry say the trick to Folklore and Superstition is simply brotherhood, family, friends and home no more, no less. <br /><br />For further information, please contact Jessica Ricci or Amy Sciarretto at Roadrunner Records:&nbsp 212.274.7500, ricci@roardrunnerrecords.com, amy@roadrunnerrecords.com.<br /><br /><br />', 2006, NULL),

They&rsquo;ve grown from relative unknowns in the United States to an impossible-to-ignore phenomenom that&rsquo;s spread across message boards and schoolyards, thanks to their tuneful, epic and guitar-driven anthems, their high-level inclusion on Guitar Hero 3:Legends of Rock and a near-constant touring schedule. The single &quot;Through the Fire and Flames&quot; has been RIAA-certified Gold and 2006&rsquo;s Inhuman Rampage, which debuted at #1 on Billboard&rsquo;s Heatseeker&rsquo;s Chart, has sold over 300,000 copies in its wake.<br /><br />Over those two fateful years following the album&rsquo;s release, the band toured America for the first time in their career and were embraced with open arms. The first tour was sold out before Inhuman Rampage even hit record store shelves and the marathon cycle continued for well over a year, as they dominated the main stage of 2006&rsquo;s Ozzfest, followed that up with a sold-out headline run and a plum support slot opening for new labelmates, Killswitch Engage, before heading home to work on Ultra Beatdown, an excellent effort that rivals its predecessor in every facet. <br /><br />Ultra Beatdown is bigger, louder and faster, teeming with guitar solos that are sure to wear the fingerprints off the hands of Herman Li and Sam Totman, the band&rsquo;s virtuoso tandem of shredders. Vocalist ZP Theart gives the performance of his career, reaching for the stars with his soaring, powerful voice, while bassist Frederic Leclercq and drummer Dave Mackintosh provide the sturdy rhythmic backbone for the album. Keytarist Vadim Pruzhanov layers the band&rsquo;s sound with a healthy dose of keys and the end result is an album that thrills with glorious guitars, siren-like vocals and memorable melodic flair. If DragonForce arrived on American shores with Inhuman Rampage, they are poised to conquer with Ultra Beatdown, set for release on August 26.<br /><br />DragonForce are much more than a band they&rsquo;re almost like a cult that has commanded a legion of diehard fans that range from guitar nerds, video game aficionados and young, impressionable kids who are just discovering music as they attempt to jam out to Dragonforce while playing Guitar Hero. <br /><br />&quot;We are not deluded, thinking we are rock stars or cool or taking over the world or are the future of metal,&quot; says Li, with his trademark dry-and possibly humble-British wit. &quot;We approached this album the same way we always have. We treat it like we haven&rsquo;t got any fans, since we are trying to make music we want to hear ourselves. We have been listening to metal for so long that we are sick and tired of hearing the same thing all the time. We want to make the catchiest album ever and we want to do something that you can&rsquo;t hear from other bands that play the same style that we do.&quot; Clearly, DragonForce are their own biggest critics they set the bar high for themselves as musicians. Li continues, &quot;We&rsquo;re not going to change our music for the world, but we&rsquo;re going to improve so we can take what we do and make it better.&quot;<br /><br />That type of passion for music is what drives DragonForce in the middle of all the Guitar Hero hype. The band remains grounded and is staying the course, infusing Ultra Beatdown with the same bombastic guitarwork and battlecry lyrics. Li is adamant that the band isn&rsquo;t going to cater to anyone but themselves and their truest fans, saying,&nbsp &quot;People were already listening to us before anyone found Inhuman Rampage. Our first US tour sold out before the album came out. People liked us before Guitar Hero. Our goal is to take all the experience we&rsquo;ve accumulated and make our live show ever better.&quot;<br /><br />The self-produced Ultra Beatdown keeps the patented DragonForce pace and burns itself into the fabric of your brain with its massive melodies and air-guitarable solos. Li sheds a little light on the songwriting process, saying &quot;When you write a song, you never know how it is going to turn out. We approach it so that we have to do the best song possible without overlooking the production, since we produce it ourselves.&nbsp We don&rsquo;t want three-minute songs you can swallow and enjoy. We like fast, seven minute songs where there is so much stuff happening. The idea is not to compromise. We can&rsquo;t deliver our message in the space of three minutes and we&rsquo;re not looking to write hits. All we want to do is write what is a great piece of music, a combination of metal and rock.&quot; <br /><br />DragonForce aren&rsquo;t masking their motives, and they back up their confidence with both skill and talent that separates them from anyone who can be considered their peers. Li says, &quot;The speed is so obvious, so that is the first thing.&nbsp So many bands play fast, even faster than us, but it&rsquo;s not melodic. Ultra Beatdown has the whole package of melody, arrangement and catchiness with the speed.&quot; The band also claims video game music as an influence, simply because it&rsquo;s melodic and memorable.<br /><br />Due to this patented style, Ultra Beatdown pulses with anthemic, feel good, battle-ready and uplifting songs. Li laughs when pointing out &quot;the funny thing is that we just want to create a catchy, memorable tune and when we do that, even the sadder songs sound happy! Our songs are tuneful but they also touch your heart.&quot;&nbsp Indeed, &quot;Heroes of Our Time,&quot; the album&rsquo;s first single, is catchy and room filling, while &quot;Last Journey Home&quot; shows a different, slower side of the band, illustrating their range and musicianship, which is something each member takes very seriously.<br /><br />While the band is known for fun live shows that often saw them jumping on trampolines and mimicking each other while performing, they are as serious as a terminal disease about their craft. &quot;Our personalities are so different,&quot; Li explains. &quot;But we got together to make an album and the whole thing comes together and is special. We have a serious side in making music, but when we are tour and people see and hear us enjoying ourselves. We&rsquo;re serious about our playing and we&rsquo;re happy with being cool and nerdy.&quot;<br /><br />Another element that makes DragonForce so special is the fact that each member hails from a different country and background. Li is from Hong Kong, while Theart was born in South Africa. Totman is a New Zealander, while Leclerqc is French, Prushanov is Romanian and Mackintosh is British. This eclectic mix and disparate upbringings contribute to the melting pot that is the band.&nbsp &quot;Many bands come from same town, same school and are very similar,&quot; Li says. &quot;With us, absolutely not. Despite the different cultures and backgrounds,&nbsp we have a common goal in the end and that is to make a great album and enjoy ourselves at the same time in life, by doing music. It&rsquo;s down to that.&quot;<br /><br />At the end of the day, according to Li, DragonForce is &quot;a non-stop melody fest. It&rsquo;s never just riffs. If there is a riff, there is a melody on top.&quot; They&rsquo;ve incorporated the influence of guitar titans like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as well as video games, thus creating a style uniquely their own that is appealing to music nerds, the general public or anyone who likes intensity in their music.<br /><br />Li finishes, summing up the band&rsquo;s recent trajectory, saying, &quot;Ultra Beatdown follows the path of our last two albums. Sonic Firestorm implies that the sound is going to blow you away, whereas Inhuman Rampage indicates that we&rsquo;re going to musically kick your ass. Ultra Beatdown is where the music is kicking your ass and giving you the biggest beatdown possible. The music is going to kick your ass.&quot; Armed with a boatload of melody and intensity, this is one Beatdown you will more than enjoy. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />', 2006, NULL),

(16, 'Killswitch Engage', '                             <p>Sometimes, a band needs to shake things up to stimulate themselves and their fans, all the while retaining the signature sonic hallmarks that have defined their sound. For their fifth album, <em>Killswitch Engage, </em>Massachusetts pioneers Killswitch Engage took calculated risks and traversed a different route, going outside their comfort zones. The choice yielded impressive, incredible results. None of the changes, however, make the mighty KsE sound like anyone else but KsE.</p><br><p>&quot;There&rsquo;s different structures, but it&rsquo;s <em>still </em>Killswitch. I tried different topics and delivery, but it&rsquo;s <em>still</em> Killswitch.&quot; says vocalist Howard Jones, summing up where KsE is in 2009.</p><br><p>After bursting onto the scene in 2002 with the genre-defining <em>Alive or Just Breathing, </em>notching a Grammy nomination in 2005 for the title track from 2004&rsquo;s Gold-certified <em>The End of Heartache </em>and<em> </em>following up that landmark album with the near-Gold <em>As Daylight Dies </em>and an appearance on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live, </em>KsE adopted a versatile, non-stop touring schedule. The band&rsquo;s road history includes two treks on Ozzfest, stints on Warped Tour and Taste of Chaos and having the rare ability to straddle the line between the metal and alternative scenes by touring with Slayer and Mastodon as easily as My Chemical Romance and Underoath. However, KsE elected not to coast on the wave of prior successes, which saw them become one of the premier, most successful bands to emerge from the so-called New Wave of American metal. The band opted to work with an outside producer for the first time in their career. Brendan O&rsquo;Brien (AC/DC, Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots) was dispatched with the task, which saw the band record in locales other than their native Massachusetts.</p><br><p>&quot;We take so much care with the music,&quot; says bassist Mike D&rsquo;Antonio. &quot;We thought, &rsquo;Let&rsquo;s take things up a notch.&rsquo; Brendan liked the band and it made sense to collaborate with him.&quot; Jones also states, in his trademark self-deprecating humor, &quot;We&rsquo;re an easily identifiable band by our guitar tone, drums, and for better or worse, my voice.&quot; Jones challenged himself to explore a broader range of topics and to use his voice in other ways. &quot;You&rsquo;ll hear some things vocally that I&rsquo;ve never done,&quot; the singer says.&nbsp Jones also comments, &quot;You can count on anthems and positive lyrics, but hey, there&rsquo;s times when the sun isn&rsquo;t shining so brightly and some songs reflect that.&quot;</p><br><p>Guitarist and KsE class clown Adam Dutkiewicz, known for his crazy, hilarious stage antics, who co-produced <em>Killswitch Engage, </em>concurs, saying, &quot;We wanted to redefine who we are a little bit. We did that by taking time to write together instead of showing up and putting parts together. We felt our last record, <em>As Daylight Dies,</em> sounded a little too much like &rsquo;us,&rsquo; if that makes sense. We want to reinvent ourselves while retaining the Killswitch Engage integrity.&quot; While so many bands approach Dutkiewicz to produce their records, asking him for that definable &quot;KsE sound,&quot; the goofy guitarist is modest about his work, saying, &quot;I guess we&rsquo;re doing something right. We like to sound good on record. Live, there might be some hijinx and too much to drink, but that&rsquo;s the rock show. When we put songs together on record, we want them to sound clean and the best they can be!&quot;</p><br><p>Dutkiewicz maintains that despite the bands change of routine, things were exciting in the camp. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want things to be a ho-hum. I want to be over the top,&quot; he says. &quot;We have attained a stature where we can afford to take risks now. That&rsquo;s not to say we will be a polka band or anything, but we can take risks, make good music and make fans happy or we will be out of jobs very quickly.&quot;</p><br><p>Quality music is the order of the day on <em>Killswitch Engage. </em>The band also wrote in a much more collaborative way. D&rsquo;Antonio says, &quot;Everyone pulled together as a team when we were writing and everyone contributed songs, which doesn&rsquo;t always happen on Killswitch records. I&rsquo;m spreading some of my Southern rock influence into the band. There was a little on the last record but there is more now. It&rsquo;s slow, dirgey, heavy stuff.&quot;</p><br><p>Drummer Justin Foley was able to contribute more to the process, saying, &quot;I didn&rsquo;t do any over thinking with my parts. When I did <em>Heartache,</em> I was so new to the band that I was fitting into the band&rsquo;s mold and a lot of my crazy playing style doesn&rsquo;t work with Killswitch, so I had to adopt a new mindset. On <em>Daylight</em>, I may have overthought. This time, I&rsquo;m so comfortable and know what we are, so the parts were natural this time around.&quot;</p><br><p>Joel Stroetzel, the unsung hero of KsE who serves as the quiet force and complement to Dutkiewicz&rsquo;s showmanship, reflects on the band&rsquo;s career, saying, &quot;It&rsquo;s been a strange, long road. We didn&rsquo;t expect it in the beginning. It started as a weekend thing, with us jamming on Saturdays and playing occasional shows at bars, pubs, VFW halls.&nbsp It turned into more than we expected.&quot; For the new album, both guitarists experimented with sounds, tones and effects pedals, according to Stroetzel.&nbsp &quot;There&rsquo;s some more spacey, ambient stuff in the background, but not in the main parts,&quot; he says. &quot;It&rsquo;s heavy and guitar-driven, but it&rsquo;s a lot more textured.&quot;</p><br><p>Again, Jones contends that the change of pace was &quot;by no means easy, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the process. I like the challenge, that&rsquo;s one of the most enjoyable things about being in a band, getting to be creative in a way that a lot people don&rsquo;t get to be in normal, every day jobs.&quot; As for the impact KsE have left on the current hard rock scene, Jones and the band are modest, humble even, about their role.&nbsp Jones says, &quot;It&rsquo;s completely unexpected and in a lot of ways, not that much has changed about the band except we&rsquo;re not in a van anymore. It&rsquo;s still the same lunkheaded guys who get on stage and make fun of each other. Nothing has really changed, except we have a few more people who like us and we&rsquo;re lucky.&quot; While the band chalks it up to luck, talent and the crafting of good music that speaks to the fans also factor into the mix with Killswitch Engage and their new self-titled release<em>. </em></p>', 2002, NULL),
(18, 'Korn', '                             <p>Korn will never forget where they came from: a dark place where salvation arrives in the form of twisted, throbbing guitar riffs, syncopated chaotic funk beats, a schizophrenic bass thump and an unmistakable cathartic howl. Emerging from the depths of Bakersfield, California with a sound unlike any other in 1994, Korn have been able to cement themselves as one of the most important bands in rock n&rsquo; roll history.</p><br><p>Over the course of eight full-length releases, Korn have sold in excess of 30 million albums and played countless sold-out shows worldwide. They&rsquo;ve won two Grammys&mdashone for Best Short Form Video for&nbsp &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; from 1998&rsquos <em>Follow the Leader</em> and one for Best Metal Performance for &quot;Here to Stay,&quot; from 2002&rsquos <em>Untouchables</em>&mdashand have launched a massively successful festival of their own, <em>The Family Values Tour</em>. However, despite all their massive success and accolades, Korn haven&rsquo;t lost hold of the savage, raw energy that made them such a crucial band for diehard rock and metal fans. Korn are one of the preeminent voices of this generation.</p><br><p>Their ninth offering, <em>Korn III &mdashRemember Who You Are</em>, is their first effort for brand new label home, Roadrunner Records, and it bursts at the seams with that very feeling that defined the band from the get-go. Each song unleashes an uneasiness reminiscent of Korn&rsquo;s earliest and most unbridled material, but there&rsquos also a modern refinement that&rsquo;s epic in its execution. &nbspKorn definitely don&rsquo;t lose sight of their roots on <em>Remember Who You Are</em>, but they also venture into uncharted darkness. All that truly matters is where they&rsquo;re going. The album strikes a balance between their past and their future, as it finds the band reuniting with producer Ross Robinson, who manned the boards for their first two records, all the while joining forces with Roadrunner Records, the world&rsquos leading rock label.</p><br><p>With <em>Korn III &ndash Remember Who You Are, </em>it&rsquo;s their time...</p><br><p>Korn bleed with unsettling and unpredictable aggression on <em>Remember Who You Are</em>&rsquo;s 10 tracks. &quot;Oildale (Leave Me Alone)&quot; buzzes with an eerie clean guitar that slowly gives way to a steamrolling bass and riff assault. &quot;Move On&quot; morphs from a myriad of creaking tones into an explosive vocal freak-out that&rsquo;s impossible not to connect with it on a visceral level. Then there&rsquo;s the neck-snapping &quot;Fear Is A Place to Live&quot; tempering deadly guitar dissonance with an unforgettable chorus. This is Korn reborn.</p><br><p>&quot;This album is a reflection of us being a band since 1993,&quot; says vocalist Jonathan Davis. &quot;We worked hard on the previous records, and we experimented a lot. For <em>Remember Who You Are</em>, the four of us got together in a small room with the intention of writing an old school Korn record. This album is a perfect mixture of everything we&rsquo;ve done, and this version of the band is the best ever.&quot; It&rsquo;s as if Korn revisited their storied beginnings, but as a wiser, tighter and more precise outfit blessed with the benefit of experience.</p><br><p>In order to tap into the chaos that made their self-titled debut a modern classic, the band enlisted the help of the man who helmed <em>Korn</em> and <em>Life is Peachy</em>&mdashproducer Ross Robinson, whose goal was to bring Korn back to square one. He undoubtedly succeeded. Davis had an intense and invigorating recording session. &quot;Ross helped us remember what we used to do this for,&quot; the singer says. &quot;It was more psychological than anything. Ross was right there pushing me and he drove me insane. I sing about a lot of things that hit really close to my heart and he knew how to trigger that. I nearly fucking broke down at the end of almost every song, but I got it all out.&quot;</p><br><p>For guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer, the experience was no different. He elaborates, &quot;Teaming up with Ross has brought that raw, emotional feeling back to the music. Ross is the only person in the world that&rsquo;s ever been able to draw us to that place. He reminds us why we&rsquo;re here, why these songs are important to our fans and why what we do as a band relates. He made us remember how our music saves lives, and he came into the picture at the perfect time. We had no record label and just wanted to make a great album. Ross stepped in at the right moment to hit the reset button.&quot;</p><br><p>Hitting that &quot;reset button&quot; involved stripping down the process. There would be no Pro-Tools, no tracking separately and no heavy post editing. In order to conjure <em>Remember Who You Are</em>&rsquo;s claustrophobic yet wholly organic chaos, Korn recorded on two-inch tape and locked themselves inside a 10x10 room buried within their Los Angeles studio, nicknamed &quot;The Cat Box.&quot; Being in such close proximity to one another stirred up a torrent of explosive music. Bassist Reggie &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu remembers, &quot;In that room, even if I turned my bass head, it would hit somebody. Getting back in there was like a family reunion. We felt like brothers again. Being older and setting egos aside, we were able to focus on making the best record we could.&quot;</p><br><p>Davis dug deep for cuts like &quot;The Past&quot; and &quot;Never Around.&quot; About &quot;The Past,&quot; the singer says, &quot;A lot of people dwell on the past, and they feel guilt. There&rsquo;s nothing you can do about the past because it&rsquo;s gone and it&rsquo;s blown up. We&rsquo;re here now.&quot; On <em>Korn III &ndash Remember Who You Are, </em>Davis is fully present and at his most vitriolic, violent and vibrant on the likes of &quot;Move On&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready to Live?&quot;</p><br><p>He goes on, &quot;I let everything flow, while I was coming up with lyrics. They&rsquo;re about me living my life for others when I shouldn&rsquo;t, people-pleasing all of the time, stress, guilt and all kinds of emotions we live with everyday that destroy us and tear us down. I write about all of the fake people around us and how I always try to fix other people&rsquo;s problems. I write what I feel, and it comes out naturally. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of shit built up inside me that doesn&rsquo;t go away.&quot;</p><br><p>Even though Korn went back to square one, they continue to break new ground. In a career marked by innovation, they <em>still </em>smash boundaries. Munky even fingerpicks certain instrumental passages, while trying out new tones on echo-y soundscapes. &quot;The heavier I play, the more you can hear the aggression. The lighter I pick, the lighter the mood is,&rdquo he said. &ldquoI used vintage guitars, echos, long delays and reverbs. When we did the first two records, we broke the music down to a completely emotional beast. Through the years, we started to experiment with vocal harmonies and more orchestrated pieces. Recording this album, we brought that knowledge into the raw emotion of what we already knew. You hear the melodies and layers, but it still comes from a very primitive Korn.&quot;</p><br><p>That primitive Korn includes drummer Ray Luzier, who became Korn&rsquo;s touring drummer in late 2007 and was made an official member in 2009. On cuts like the deadly &quot;Fear is a Place to Live,&quot; he propels the aggression. Fieldy says, &quot;Ray is like the missing Korn member we never had. He just fits so well. When we found him, it just clicked because his playing sounds like Korn. He plays with me, and the way that he plays is exactly what I needed. We know what we&rsquo;re doing on stage with each other, and everybody&rsquo;s on the same page. I&rsquo;ve waited my whole career for Korn to sound like we do now.&quot;</p><br><p>Korn may have changed members with Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch and David Silveria departing in 2005 and 2006 respectively, but Jonathan, Munky, Fieldy and Ray capture the feeling that was there in the beginning.</p><br><p>For Davis, the album name covers it all. &quot;It comes down to one question: &rsquo;Who the fuck am I?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s about remembering where we came from. The title sums up everything I&rsquo;m talking about lyrically. During the first two records, we were kids, and we didn&rsquo;t have anything. We were making music, having fun and not worrying. I went back to that place where I wasn&rsquo;t worried. I wanted to be completely honest with my feelings, express myself and let them out. People get so wrapped up in social communities, the Internet and technology that they forget who they are and what life&rsquo;s really about. I fucking forgot who I was until I did this record. This album is just a bass, a guitar, drums and my vocals. I look at the records we&rsquo;ve done as slots in time, and I believe <em>Remember Who You Are</em> is very special.&quot;</p><br><p>The album captures the band&rsquo;s legendary performance style that&rsquo;s ignited crowds worldwide on stages ranging from <em>OZZfest </em>and <em>Projekt Revolution </em>to <em>Woodstock</em> and <em>Download</em>. It&rsquo;s the same spirit that gave pop culture hits such as &quot;Blind,&quot; &quot;A.D.I.D.A.S.,&quot; &quot;Got the Life,&quot; &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; and &quot;Twisted Transistor.&quot; It&rsquos clear, however, that <em>Korn III &ndash Remember Who You Are </em>is another thrilling chapter being etched into Korn&rsquos already impressive history.</p><br><p>&quot;There&rsquo;s that timeless space that we enter where nothing else matters on stage,&quot; says Munky. &quot;It&rsquo;s us, the crowd and the music. We lose track of where we are and who we are, and it&rsquo;s just a timeless shared space between us and the audience. We lose ourselves in the music. I want fans to lose themselves in the new music by forgetting about any problems or anything going on in their minds and let their hearts hear it. It&rsquo;s the same experience that I get when I&rsquo;m on stage.&quot;</p><br><p>The process brought them back to the beginning, but it also encouraged serious growth. Everyone is locked in like never before. Fieldy adds, &quot;We want to take you on a rollercoaster with this record. There are spacey and weird parts where the bass can breathe and there are some heavy moments. On <em>Remember Who You Are</em>, I&rsquo;m doing what I really wanted to do on our first record.&quot;</p><br><p>In the end, this is for the people that made Korn&mdashthe millions of kids worldwide that buy every record, wear every shirt and never miss a show. Davis concludes, &quot;I love doing what I do. I love helping kids. I love hearing fans say, &rsquo;You got me through this or that.&rsquo; It makes me feel like I&rsquo;ve done something positive. I want kids to feel what I&rsquo;m saying and really hear it. I&rsquo;d love for the new songs to provoke them to think about what goes on around them. We&rsquo;re very fortunate to keep doing what we&rsquo;re doing, still be relevant and create music that invokes feelings from people.&quot;</p><br><p>With music this powerful, no one will ever forget who Korn are.</p>', 2010, NULL);

About survival of spirit unbowed, uniquely American, stubbornly resolute.</p><br><p>With their first set of new studio material since 2003&rsquos <em>Vicious Cycle</em>, legendary rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd returns with <strong><em>God &amp Guns</em></strong>, due out September 29 on <strong>Loud &amp Proud/Roadrunner Records</strong>. Recorded in Nashville in 2008-2009, the project was interrupted&mdashbut, tellingly, not ended&mdashby the deaths of founding member/keyboardist <strong>Billy Powell</strong> and longtime bassist <strong>Ean Evans</strong> earlier this year.</p><br><p>Driven by core members <strong>Gary Rossington</strong> (guitar), <strong>Johnny Van Zant</strong> (vocals) and <strong>Rickey Medlocke</strong> (guitar), along with longtime drummer <strong>Michael Cartellone</strong>, Lynyrd Skynyrd have recorded an album (&ldquounder duress, as usual,&rdquo according to Van Zant) that very much lives up to the legacy begun some 35 years ago in Jacksonville, Florida, and halted for a decade by the 1977 plane crash that killed three band members, including Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines. Since then, the band tragically lost Allen Collins, Leon Wilkeson and Huey Thomasson, yet they rock on.</p><br><p>With the passing of Powell and Evans, &ldquoa lot of people probably expected us to say enough is enough,&rdquo admits Medlocke.&nbsp But that would not be the way of this Rock &amp Roll Hall of Fame powerhouse. With a catalog of over 60 albums and sales beyond 30 million, Lynyrd Skynyrd remains a cultural icon that appeals to all generations, and <em>God &amp Guns</em> is a fitting addition to the canon. The <em>Skynyrd Nation</em> awaits.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe wanted to show the people that not only are we doing the old material, keeping the music going, but we still have some new tricks up our sleeves, too,&rdquo says founding guitarist Gary Rossington.</p><br><p>Returning to the studio after the death of Powell, whose keyboards can be heard on more than half the songs on <em>God &amp Guns</em>, was &ldquovery difficult, I ain&rsquot gonna lie to you,&rdquo says Van Zant. &ldquoBut we got through it, as Lynyrd Skynyrd seems to always do. Music&rsquos a great healer. These songs needed to be out there, this record needed to be made. Gary, Rickey and myself just said &lsquolet&rsquos go for it, let&rsquos get this thing done.&rsquo&rdquo</p><br><p>Unfortunately, coping with loss is familiar to this band. &ldquoWe just kind of fell back in,&rdquo says Rossington. &ldquoWe&rsquove been doing this a long time, so you just kind of do what you do. As you get older, you get a little more used to it. You know it&rsquos coming, and it&rsquos coming to you, too. I just thank God for every day and all the time I had with the guys that aren&rsquot with us anymore.&rdquo</p><br><p>The crying is over and now it&rsquos time to rock. &ldquoWe&rsquove had some really bad moments this year already, and I&rsquom glad we&rsquore able to pick ourselves up by our boot straps and just continue to play,&rdquo says Medlocke. &ldquoFor us to weather through this makes this record even more special. I&rsquom sure Billy and Ean are looking down upon us with big smiles.&rdquo</p><br><p>With noted rock producer <strong>Bob Marlette</strong>, input from guitarist <strong>John 5</strong>, and a wealth of material written by the band and a cadre of elite Skynyrd-minded songwriters, a remarkable album emerged. &ldquoWe never really worked with producers that well, we kind of always wanted to do it our way,&rdquo admits Rossington. &ldquoBut Bob Marlette came on and he&rsquos such a great guy he figured out how to talk to us musically, and we became friends instantly. He had a lot of fresh ideas and ways to do things, and also wanted to capture the old sounds, too.&rdquo</p><br><p>Of John 5, Rossington adds, &ldquohe&rsquos probably one of the best guitar players I&rsquove ever played with, and I&rsquove played with a lot of great ones. He just lives with a guitar on him, and he knows that neck like nobody I&rsquove ever seen.&rdquo</p><br><p>With a backbone of Southern rock and country, passionate Van Zant vocals, and trademark layered guitars, <em>God &amp Guns</em> manages to maintain the iconic Skynyrd punch while sounding completely contemporary. Sure to attract attention in these politically divided times is the title track, which harbors a sense of menace and unwillingness to back down that hearkens back to Skynyrd&rsquos earliest days. The band knows the song, and others like &ldquoThat Ain&rsquot My America,&rdquo will have their critics, but Medlocke says listeners should get beyond the title.</p><br><p>&ldquoIt&rsquos not just the words &lsquoGod and guns.&rsquo you gotta look past that and look at what this country was founded on: freedom,&rdquo Medlocke says. &ldquoEverybody should be able to make their own decisions and not be led around by a nose ring and told what to do and when to do it.&rdquo</p><br><p>And if some critics don&rsquot like it, &ldquothat&rsquos called freedom of choice,&rdquo says Medlocke, who carries his Native American heritage with pride. &ldquoI&rsquom sure some critics will look at it, <em>God &amp Guns</em>, the rednecks are back.&rsquo Well, the guys in this band aren&rsquot rednecks, Rickey Medlocke&rsquos the only damn redneck in this band &lsquocause I got red skin.&rdquo</p><br><p>The title track, along with the unmistakable Skynyrd bite of the first single &ldquoStill Unbroken,&rdquo form thematic songs for an album laden with attitude, heart and purpose. &ldquoSkynyrd&rsquos about tradition,&rdquo says Medlocke. &ldquoWe are guys that don&rsquot go around preaching about our own personal or political beliefs, although I&rsquom sure you could probably guess mine. In this record is personal tragedy, personal relationships and being on the road, all under that umbrella of real life. That&rsquos what we think, that&rsquos what we believe, and we stand next to that title, <em>God &amp Guns</em>.&rdquo</p><br><p>To portray Skynyrd as a bunch of &ldquogun nuts&rdquo would be incorrect, according to Van Zant. &ldquoI&rsquom kind of like Ronnie, &lsquohandguns are made for killing,&rsquo and I&rsquove never seen anybody shoot a deer with a .38,&rdquo he says. &ldquoI do own a bunch of rifles, I live out in the swamp, and you&rsquove got to protect yourself.&rdquo</p><br><p>Skynyrd is a band, after all, that has never shied away from standing up and speaking for a segment of the population whose voices are seldom heard. &ldquoEverybody&rsquos so scared to say stuff these days, that&rsquos not what I&rsquom about,&rdquo says Van Zant. &ldquoWe live in America, we can speak our minds. These are our values. That doesn&rsquot mean we&rsquore always right in everybody&rsquos mind. Hopefully, we don&rsquot offend a bunch of people. And if we do, well, get a record deal, man, and make your own songs.&rdquo</p><br><p>This is a band well aware of the responsibility that comes with putting the name &lsquoLynyrd Skynyrd&rsquo on anything, be it an album or a concert. &ldquoWe feel like we have to keep the standards high,&rdquo says Rossington. &ldquoI wouldn&rsquot put this record out, I&rsquod fight not to, if I didn&rsquot think it was good.&rdquo</p><br><p>And so Skynyrd stands, &ldquostill unbroken,&rdquo in 2009. &ldquoPeople may say, &lsquothey need the money,&rsquo well I don&rsquot think any of us need the money,&rdquo Van Zant says. &ldquoIt&rsquos just that we love the music, it&rsquos bigger than the money, it&rsquos not even about that any more. We have to make a living, sure, but it&rsquos about the legacy of Lynyrd Skynyrd, and what it stands for, what the fans are all about. There&rsquos nothing like getting out there playing a great show with Skynyrd and seeing people love this music.&rdquo</p><br><p>Adds Rossington, &ldquoWe&rsquore still standing, still keeping the music going. We wanted to do the guys who aren&rsquot with us any more proud, and keep the name proud, too.&rdquo</p>', 2009, NULL),
(20, 'Machine Head', '                             How do you create a masterpiece of modern metal?&nbsp Is it a conscious effort on the part of the artists or is it something more organic - a confluence of events and moods, emotions and mechanics that all come together in the right place at the right time?&nbsp That&#39s the question that comes to mind upon the first listen to <strong>Machine Head</strong>&#39s sixth studio album <em><strong>The Blackening</strong>.&nbsp </em>Guitars rip, drums pound, bass thunders and lyrics resonate as the Bay Area quartet soars past the bar set by its critically-lauded predecessor <em><strong>Through the Ashes of Empires</strong>.&nbsp </em>If <em><strong>Empires</strong> </em>was the sounding of the trumpet, then <em><strong>The Blackening</strong> </em>is the arrival of the hordes: dense, aggressive and inescapable. <p>Produced once again by singer/guitarist Robb Flynn&nbsp(<strong>Roadrunner United</strong>, <strong>Machine Head</strong>) and mixed by Colin Richardson (Bullet For My Valentine, Funeral For A Friend), <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em> pushes the band&#39s groundbreaking sound farther than it&#39s ever gone before.&nbsp Challenging themselves and each other to write a record that would demolish all of their boundaries, the band has delivered 60 minutes of the most structurally complex and technical material that <strong>Machine Head</strong> has ever recorded.&nbsp Three part guitar and bass harmonies, dueling solos, and savage thrash intricacy sit alongside soaring 3 part vocal harmonies, ultimately crashing head first into bludgeoning, Neanderthal riffage. &quotPushing ourselves came pretty naturally with <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em>. &quotAfter writing&nbspsongs like &quotImperium,&quot &quotVim&quot and&nbsp&quotDays Turn Blue To Gray&quot on the last album,&nbspwe&nbspfelt really comfortable magnifying the complexity of our&nbspsongs and it really shows on this album,&quot exclaims drummer Dave McClain. That fact becomes brilliantly obvious after listening to just the first few minutes of album opener &quotClenching the Fists of Dissent.&quot&nbsp Yet, those &quotfirst few minutes&quot are merely a portion of what the ten-minute epic has in store for the listener, serving both literally and figuratively as the war cry for the record and setting the stage for the colossal statement that is <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em>.</p><p>Fighting alongside the band&#39s monstrous musical effort are Robb&#39s gritty, streetwise lyrics which teeter effortlessly between brutal metal shouting and lush, melodic singing.&nbsp Going from what has recently been a more introspective focus, the words that grace <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em> return to the socially-conscious narrative so prevalent throughout their earlier albums, focusing heavily on issues that touch one and all.&nbsp &quotThe nature of the times during the writing of this album led to a very dismal atmosphere throughout... this is far and away the darkest material that we&#39ve ever written&quot states Flynn.&nbsp With lyrics that refuse to tread lightly when it comes to politics, war and organized religion, Robb spits anger and disdain in the truest spirit of the angst that fueled early 80&#39s punk rock.&nbsp Songs such as the aforementioned opener &quotClenching the Fists of Dissent,&quot the massive &quotHalo&quot and epic album closer &quotA Farewell To Arms&quot attest to that fact.</p><p>Continuing the theme, &quotAesthetics of Hate&quot captures the band&#39s anger towards a story that surfaced right after the tragic death of Dimebag Darrell that bashed both the legendary guitarist and the metal community as a whole.&nbsp &quotNow I Lay Thee Down&quot plays like a twisted Romeo &amp Juliet with its own ugly ending. &quotSlanderous&quot addresses the hate and name-calling&nbspthat still permeates throughout society, even in today&#39s &quotPC&quot climate.&nbsp &quotBeautiful Mourning&quot speaks to the lowest of low points in a life, while &quotWolves&quot references the strength and power of the pack, speaking to Machine Head&#39s rabid fans as well as the band itself. </p><p>And with good reason to witness <strong>Machine Head</strong> live is to understand both their unique internal chemistry and the undeniable bond that the band shares with its audience. With a performance that has been honed and strengthened through nearly nine years of non-stop worldwide touring, <strong>Machine Head</strong> are touted by many as the best live band in metal. &nbspOftentimes one can barely hear the band perform over the din of the audience singing along to favorites, new and old alike. Tickets for the band&#39s recent sold-out U.K. tour elicited bids in excess of $300 per pair on eBay and had bootleggers selling rip-offs of frontman Robb Flynn&#39s coveted &quotFUCT&quot stage T-shirt.</p><p>One can fully appreciate the band&#39s current level of success by looking back on their less-than-glamorous beginnings:&nbsp beer-fueled rehearsals in an Oakland warehouse that they shared with 4 punk rock bands, playing their first parties, local shows (some members not even old enough at the time to get into the 21+ clubs they were booked in) with the likes of Rancid, Deftones and Napalm Death. To spread the word, <strong>Machine Head</strong> took guerrilla marketing into their own hands, relentlessly flyering high schools and stickering unsuspecting cars at metal and punk shows. The band&#39s first demo - recorded for $800 in a friend&#39s bedroom, with their amps in the bathroom - was a very rough estimation of their burgeoning sound, a combination of the aggression of metal and punk, and the social anger of urban rap, intertwined with hypnotic Alice In Chains-esque vocal harmonies. It was this demo that eventually made it into the hands of Roadrunner Records, setting into motion the course of events that would lead to the 1994 release of their groundbreaking debut, <em><strong>Burn My Eyes</strong></em>.</p><p>Resplendent with some of the heaviest guitar tones ever heard in metal (thanks to their pioneering use of a dropped B tuning, and Peavey 5150 amplifiers - virtually unknown prior to <em>BME</em>) and released the same year as such seminal albums as Pantera&#39s <em>Far Beyond Driven</em>, AFI&#39s <em>Answer That and Stay Fashionable</em> and In Flames&#39 <em>Subterranean</em>, <em><strong>Burn My Eyes</strong></em> crashed head-first into the then-barren metal world.&nbsp Critical praise overseas, combined with 17 months of non-stop touring (including 5 months with Slayer), a U.S. headline tour that had them booked at every pool hall, strip bar, and rock club in America, a European headline tour that had them booked in the very same venues they had just supported Slayer, <em><strong>Burn My Eyes</strong></em> went on to become the biggest-selling debut in the history of Roadrunner Records at the time, and would soon serve as the template for much of the &#39metalcore&#39 sound that dominates the aggressive music market today.&nbsp </p><p>Their annihilating follow-up <em><strong>The More Things Change...</strong></em> would see the band expand their trademark sound, pushing the envelope even further. Several high-profile tours in America followed, including Ozzfest (which saw the band flirt with expulsion after starting an on-stage grass-throwing riot in Detroit), firmly established Machine Head as a live draw to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, the bands&#39 hard drinking reputation and dependence on alcohol and drugs began to get the best of them.&nbsp Then-guitarist Logan Mader would quit the band, and Flynn would enter therapy soon afterward to deal with his own problems.<br /><br />Choosing to face his demons head on, the frontman confronted his issues through his lyrics. Rather than lashing out at society, he exorcised his own personal demons, purging his psychological wounds on the emotionally-charged shockwave that was their 3rd album,<em> <strong>The Burning Red</strong></em>.&nbsp Flynn&#39s confessions on the songs &quotFive&quot and &quotThe Burning Red&quot were lyrical scars torn wide open, revealing dark truths that he had yet to even share with many of his closest friends. This heightened lyrical heft lent itself to even greater musical experimentation, with the band incorporating such lesser known influences as The Cure, and the guitar psychedelics of Jimi Hendrix into their healthy dose of metal.&nbsp Bassist Adam Duce agrees, &quot<em><strong>The Burning Red</strong></em> was a brave and pretty bold step forward.&nbsp We felt like we had kind of backed ourselves into a corner after <em><strong>The More Things Change...</strong></em>, so we decided to take some risks, screw playing it safe.&quot&nbsp The risk paid off, with <em><strong>The Burning Red</strong></em> allowing <strong>Machine Head</strong> to expand its fan base outside of the metal genre in the U.S., and abroad.&nbsp Subsequent tours of the U.S., and again more dates with Slayer in such far-away places as Korea, Japan, Australia, and Europe,&nbspwould take the band to previously un-scaled heights.</p><p>While the band&#39s 4th effort <em><strong>Supercharger</strong></em> would produce such live concert favorites as &quotBulldozer&quot and the harrowing &quotTrephination&quot - a fact solidly reinforced on their follow-up live album <em><strong>HellaLive</strong></em> (recorded at a sold-out 5000-capacity concert at London&#39s Brixton Academy) - as well as include two U.S. headlining tours, their first-ever festival headlining appearance at Germany&#39s With Full Force Festival, and a slot at Japan&#39s &quotBeast Feast&quot festival, both the band and fans alike felt that <strong>Machine Head</strong> could push themselves harder, challenging themselves to forge something that was once again fresh and innovative.</p><p>Enter 2003&#39s <em><strong>Through the Ashes of Empires</strong></em>.&nbsp Hailed by critics and fans alike as a metal masterpiece, <em><strong>Through the Ashes of Empires</strong></em> went on to become the 2nd-best selling record for Roadrunner Records Europe that year.&nbsp Six months later in the Spring of 2004, the album saw its U.S. release, also via Roadrunner. The album debuted at #88 on the Billboard Top 200 (tying <strong>Machine Head</strong>&#39s highest debut ever) and their follow-up live DVD <em><strong>Elegies</strong></em> bullied its way to #13 on the U.S. Billboard charts, and #4 on the U.K. charts.&nbsp Their three U.S. headline tours of clubs and small theaters (garnering a direct support slot for Lamb Of God on select U.S. dates) and their two European headline tours of large and small theaters achieved stellar numbers, selling out nearly all shows in major markets throughout both continents. The band&#39s European summer festival run included blistering appearances at Germany&#39s Rock Am Ring / Rock Am Park (as direct support to Korn and Evanescence), a show-stealing Donington performance as direct support to Slipknot and Metallica, prompting fans to vote <strong>Machine Head</strong> &quotBest Band of the Day&quot on Download&#39s official U.K. website, and finally, a headlining slot atop Germany&#39s prestigious Wacken festival (with the fans once again electing <strong>Machine Head</strong> &quotBest Band of the Festival&quot on Wacken&#39s official website), would wrap up what was nothing short of a spectacular run for the band. </p><p>Little did anyone know what they had in store... with lead guitarist Phil Demmel firmly entrenched in the ranks, and drummer Dave McClain practicing upwards of 7 hours a day, the band re-entered the studio with a near-insatiable hunger and new thirst to create.&nbsp Guitarist Phil Demmel notes, &quotSince I was only in the band long enough to&nbspcontribute to a few songs for &#39<em><strong>Ashes</strong></em>&#39, I really wanted to put a signature Flynn/Demmel stamp on this albums&#39 material. &nbspWe really pushed each other with the riff interplay and the harmony solos to a&nbsphigh point in this bands&#39 history.&quot&nbsp Singer/guitarist Robb Flynn echoes that sentiment, stating that &quotIn many ways this was the most important record of our career. We needed to make a record that was fearless in its ability to embrace, but not be limited by what we had accomplished before. &nbspAll of our musical heroes have made monumental records that didn&#39t necessarily go with the evolution of their band a perfect example would be The Cure from <em>Pornography</em> to <em>Disintegration</em>, or Metallica from <em>Kill &lsquoem All</em> to <em>Master of Puppets</em>. Those bands destroyed their drawing board and reconstructed it.&quot </p><p>And it is that fearlessness that has allowed <strong>Machine He</strong>ad to make music that is daring, true and honest.&nbsp Never creating the same album twice, they&#39ve stuck their necks out numerous times, always looking to push the envelope just a little further.&nbsp And while any time you take a risk, some results may fare better than others, there&#39s one thing you can always be sure of - the <strong>Machine Head</strong> album you&#39re listening to is the album they wanted to create. Compromise has never been an option for <strong>Machine Head</strong>.&nbsp With <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em>, that same creed of indomitable passion and unflinching sincerity has brought us the genuine article, having yet again set a new high watermark for themselves as well as the genre.&nbsp Don&#39t let the name fool you... <em><strong>The Blackening</strong></em> is, without a doubt, <strong>Machine Head</strong>&#39s brightest moment.</p>', 1994, NULL),

(22, 'Meat Loaf', '                             <p>Some people think big. Some people think huge. And then there&rsquo;s Meat Loaf.<br /> <br /> For the past 35 years, the man born Marvin Lee Aday has been a towering monument on the musical landscape.&nbsp His legendary 1977 album <strong>Bat Out Of Hell</strong> transformed this former high school football player, nightclub bouncer and stage actor into one of the great American rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll icons. That record, with its staggering operatic sound and impassioned vocals, has sold more than 43 million albums worldwide - still one of the biggest-selling records of all time.<br /> <br /> Meat Loaf&rsquo;s reputation as one of music&rsquo;s greatest artists was underlined by such masterpieces as <strong>Dead Ringer</strong> (1981), <strong>Bad Attitude</strong> (1984) and the <strong>Bat Out Of Hell </strong>sequels <strong>Bat Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell</strong> (1993) and <strong>Bat Out Of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose </strong>(2006). Other artists might have tried to match his scale and copy his sound, but no one has come close.</p><br><p><br /> Now, more than 30 years after he exploded onto the world stage, Meat Loaf is back with a new record, <strong>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</strong> (a title taken from a line in the classic Russ Meyer trash movie &ldquoBeyond The Valley Of The Dolls&rdquo). From opener &ldquoPeace On Earth&rdquo to closer &ldquoElvis In Vegas,&rdquo its 13 tracks drag the classic Meat Loaf sound kicking and screaming into the 21st century.<br /> <br /> &quot;I wanted it big, I wanted it dramatic, I wanted a rock record,&quot; says Meat Loaf. &quot;Yes, it sounds like a Meat Loaf record. But it sounds different too - it sounds new, it sounds fresh. It speaks to you in a different way.&quot;<br /> <br /> Much of this newfound energy can be put down to Meat Loaf&rsquo;s working relationship with his new collaborator, producer Rob Cavallo (Green Day, My Chemical Romance Paramore, Fleetwood Mac). For the singer, it was a chance to work with one of the hottest producers around. For Cavallo, it was an opportunity to work with a childhood hero and a proper rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll legend.<br /> <br /> &quot;Rob is the Number 1 rock producer in the world because he leaves his ego out of the equation and gives an artist his voice, making it sound better than the artist could even imagine,&quot; says Meat. &quot;I was like a fisherman looking for a big mouthed bass. I put on the right worm. The first song I played to him, I hooked him. The second song, I nailed him.&quot;<br /> <br /> The pair hit it off immediately, and this electrifying creative partnership immediately raised the bar several feet. Meat Loaf brought more than 40 songs to the table, which the duo whittled down to the 13 that appear on the final record, including the furious &ldquoLiving On The Outside&rdquo and hilarious &ldquoLosAngeloser.&rdquo<br /> <br /> But there was one other piece to the jigsaw: Los Angeles-based screenwriter and director Kilian Kerwin, a long-time friend of the singer. As with every classic Meat Loaf album, <strong>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</strong> has a bigger concept. It was one of Kerwin&rsquo;s short stories that inspired the singer to come up with the album&rsquo;s striking narrative.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&rsquo;s the story of a soldier,&quot; reveals Meat Loaf. &quot;He&rsquo;s been in battle and he&rsquo;s lying face down on the ground. He can&rsquo;t move, but he turns his head and starts to see blood run across the ground, and so he thinks he&rsquo;s going to die. They always say you see your life flash backwards you when you&rsquo;re about to die. But his life flashes forward - into what possibly could happen. He sees what his life could be - the good and the bad. The songs are the different scenarios he finds himself in. It&rsquo;s not always the same time or the same place - but it&rsquo;s always the same woman. But I don&rsquo;t want to give too much away - I want people to work it out for themselves.&quot;<br /> <br /> To flesh out his vision, Meat Loaf enlisted a set of elite musicians to play on the album, including guitarists Tim Pierce, Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins (who co-wrote two songs for the album),&nbspPaul Crook and Randy Flowers, legendary bass players Chris Chaney and Kasim Sulton, genius keyboardist Jamie Mulhoberac and the world&rsquos greatest rock drummer&nbsp(just ask Rob Cavallo) John Micelli. &nbsp<strong>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</strong> also features a stellar array of big-name guests, including Steve Vai (who appears on &ldquoLove is Not Real&rdquo), former Queen guitarist Brian May (who appears on &ldquoSong Of Madness&rdquo and &ldquoLove Is Not Real&rdquo), American Idol presenter Kara DioGuardi (who co-wrote and sings on &ldquoIf I Can&rsquo;t Have You&rdquo) and Hollywood star Jack Black, who duets with Meat Loaf on &ldquoLike A Rose.&rdquo&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>But the most surprising guest is Hugh Laurie - the English actor famous for starring in <em>Blackadder</em> and hit US TV show <em>House</em>. It was while making a guest appearance on the latter that Meat Loaf met Laurie and discovered that he was a classically-trained pianist. What else could he do but ask the actor to play piano on the song &ldquoIf I Can&rsquo;t Have You?&rdquo<br /> <br /> &quot;He was really nervous at first,&quot; recalls Meat Loaf. &quot;It was strange seeing someone so confident on a TV set walk into the studio like he&rsquo;s a quivering mess. But he nailed it. He&rsquo;s talking about playing it with us if we ever go on <em>American Idol</em>.&quot;</p><br><p><br /> &quot;What I love about&nbspHugh, Jack and Kara,&quot; says Meat Loaf. &quot;Is that sometimes you get people coming to the studio, and they have their manager and a bodyguard and an entourage - it&rsquo;s this endless stream of people. The 3 of them, they just drove up to the studio in their own cars, no bullshit no fronts, just real people. &nbspAnd I love real people.&quot;<br /> <br /> But for all the star guests, <strong>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</strong> is Meat Loaf&rsquo;s album &ndash his own dirty little secret. More than four decades into his career, the man - and his voice - is as big, bold and important as ever.<br /> <br /> &quot;How do I keep the fire burning?&quot; he asks. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know. I just do. I&rsquo;d bet in advance that if I sat with somebody in a room and said to them, &rsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you five pounds if you don&rsquo;t go &rsquo;Whoah!&rsquo; after the first song&rsquo;, they&rsquo;d forget about the five pounds and they&rsquo;d go &rsquo;Whoah!&rsquo;. You can&rsquo;t help it. And it&rsquo;s like that across all the songs. This record is spectacular!&quot;</p>', 2010, NULL),

The album&rsquos signature track &ldquoHead Crusher&rdquo should not merely serve as a wake-up for old fans but also a new generation ready to keep Mustaine &amp Co.&rsquos brand of shredding guitar and bellicose songsmanship at the forefront of today&rsquos metal scene.</p><br><p>This, however, is not surprising for the man who has created and branded &ldquoGigantour,&rdquo which for the past three years has united some of metal&rsquos most musically literate players including Dream Theater, Children of Bodom and Opeth.&nbsp Then again, what else would one expect from someone who culled a sound from The New Wave of British Heavy Metal and created metal&rsquos then new chic, which was state of the art speed metal?</p><br><p>The Megadeth machine is built on a blueprint of stark, complex musicianship. Over time, with album sales nearing 25 million worldwide, Mustaine has balanced rabid-dog aggression with staggering song-craft. The albums <em>Killing Is My Business&hellipAnd Business Is Good!</em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>,</span> <em>Peace Sells&hellipBut Who&rsquos Buying?</em> , <em>So Far&hellipSo Good&hellipSo What?</em> and <em>Countdown to Extinction</em> remain true metal classics. No surprise then that Mustaine was awarded the title of &ldquoRiff Lord&rdquo at 2008&rsquos Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards in the U.K, or that he was crowned &ldquoGolden God&rdquo at the 2009 Revolver Golden Gods Awards in America.</p><br><p><br /> Which of course shouldn&rsquot negate the flirting with commercial success on <em>Youthanasia</em>, <em>Cryptic</em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;> </span><em>Writings</em> or <em>Risk</em>. Or even Megadeth&rsquos road back to the standing at the top of metal&rsquos top players with <em>World Needs a Hero</em>, <em>The System Has Failed</em> and their Roadrunner debut, <em>United Abominations</em>. &ldquoIt was a good lesson about the need to follow your heart,&rdquo says Dave of the creative process with <em>Endgame.</em> &ldquoI am grateful to have fans who have let me stretch my wings musically. But this is where I am most comfortable.&rdquo</p><br><p>At this point, Dave Mustaine has nothing to prove. To make the record he wanted, Mustaine found himself building a full-blown recording studio in San Marcos, California, just outside of San Diego, dubbed &ldquoVic&rsquos Garage&rdquo after Megadeth&rsquos&nbspiconic, skull-faced mascot Vic Rattlehead. His rationale for building a studio for Megadeth was simple: &ldquoWhen we went into the studio last time it was too expensive, too extravagant, too arrogant and I think it made us a little lazy,&rdquo muses Mustaine.</p><br><p>Andy Sneap,&nbspmetal-producer&nbspand mixer par-excellence and a Megadeth cohort from <em>United Abominations</em>,&nbspreturned to work alongside of Mustaine. The result of this metal-mongering synergy speaks for itself. &ldquoIt&rsquos a great relationship,&rdquo says Mustaine of his ongoing dealings with the acclaimed British producer, also known for his work with Killswitch Engage and Machine Head.&nbsp &ldquoWe had a few intense moments, but that is part of having a real working relationship. I am a better guitarist, singer and producer due to my tremendous respect for Andy and my open ears when he is listening or isn&rsquot listening to my point of view.&rdquo</p><br><p>Part of Megadeth&rsquos new energies on <em>ENDGAME </em>goes to the induction of guitarist Chris Broderick, who joins Mustaine, drummer Shawn Drover and bassist James LoMenzo in the &lsquoMegs tightest line-up in years.&nbsp Mustaine even went on record to say, &ldquoWith this album, I am also very excited to be introducing my new lead guitarist, Chris Broderick, to the world. I have always felt lucky to have had top shredders in that position, but after touring with Chris in support of my last album, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get into the studio and see what he could do.&quot;<br /> <br /> Not one to keep an exactly cheery lyrical stance, <em>ENDGAME </em>finds Mustaine more scalding and articulate than ever. Sure, there&rsquos &ldquo1,320&rdquo, a paean to the thrills of nitro funny car racing, but from there, it grows darker and darker. The Edgar Allen Poe waxing &ldquoThe Hardest Part of Letting Go&hellipSealed With A Kiss&rdquo finds the narrator entombing his beloved in a wall of bricks whilst Broderick shifts from beautific acoustics to Megadeth&rsquos riffy snarl.&nbsp</p><br><p>But it&rsquos a landscape of bitter realities where Mustaine&rsquos lyrics resonate. &ldquoBite The Hand That Feeds&rdquo and &ldquoThe Right To Go Insane&rdquo delve into an economically disenfranchised nation of have and have-nots. Mustaine himself is no stranger to politics, a self-admitted CNN junkie who in 1992 was MTV&rsquos floor commentator at the National Democratic Convention.</p><br><p><em>ENDGAME&rsquos</em> title track is Mustaine at his darkest. &quot;Thematically, I&rsquo;ve never been known to be a silent bystander in a world that needs our participation,&rdquo he says. &lsquoEndgame&rsquo specifically is a document signed into law that further strips away personal civil rights. &ldquoIt&rsquos a bill that George W. Bush had signed into law that could put an American citizen in a prison, much like a concentration camp,&rdquo states Mustaine. Far-fetched?&nbsp Surprisingly not.</p><br><p>Musically and lyrically&nbsp Dave Mustaine remains metal&rsquos true iconoclast whose latest musical offering rumbles with the intensity his career has been built on.

Even though Joey&rsquo;s live role in Murderdolls is axe-slinging, his one-of-a-kind drumming fuels the album. Produced by Zeuss [Hatebreed, Shadows Fall] <em>Women and Children Last</em> exists in an evil little place tucked somewhere in a back alley behind the thrash, glam, punk and arena rock super highways, and Murderdolls have arrived to rip pop culture a new one. All you can do is sing along while they haul off your daughter&hellip</p><br><p>Murderdolls began festering within the collective hard rock consciousness in 2002 when they dropped their debut, <em>Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls</em>. A sensation with fans and critics &ndashAllmusic said &ldquoCall it gutter-punk, glam rock, or hair metal, every style is displayed here in its despondent glory&rdquo&mdash the album debuted at #1 on Billboard&rsquos Heatseekers chart, despite the fact that the band played a mere 15 shows on U.S. soil.&nbsp A soundtrack appearance soon followed (<em>Freddy Vs Jason</em>).&nbsp Truly an international sensation, <em>Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls</em> achieved Silver status in the U.K., where the band was especially loved: television appearances, magazine covers and sold out shows in 5,000 capacity venues abounded. Burning bright and living up to their out-of-control image, the band toured the world for two years, then took a well-deserved break.&nbsp Joey returned to the studio and the road for two earth-shattering Slipknot records, <em>Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses</em> (2004) and <em>All Hope Is Gone</em> (2008). Meanwhile Wednesday continued to put out solo records independently and to play for his rabid fans all over the globe. While on tour with their respective bands, Joey and Wednesday often fielded the same question from fans: When will the Murderdolls be back?</p><br><p>After Jordison finished an extensive, 18-month world tour with Slipknot in 2009, there was no better time to revive the beast. He and Wednesday began texting back and forth, quoting <em>Raising Arizona </em>and <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre,</em> and the pair knew the chemistry remained.&nbsp They began to plot what would become <em>Women and Children Last </em>and were soon holed up in a Hollywood Hills studio in March 2010, with 25 days to record their second unholy offering. They instantly connected over eight years worth of demos and a flurry of new ideas. It was like no break had ever even occurred.</p><br><p>For Jordison, who is spending the summer of 2010 touring with Rob Zombie, this album is the start of something very important. &quot;I consider <em>Women and Children Last</em> the <em>first</em> Murderdolls record,&quot; exclaims the multi-instrumental mastermind. &quot;The music is so much heavier now. Murderdolls haven&rsquo;t lost the fun, crazy vibe, but the topics are smarter. <em>Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls</em> was like a sketch and this is the real painting.&quot;</p><br><p>To paint this picture with just the right palette of anger and insidiousness, Wednesday dug deep. &nbspHe declares, &quot;It&rsquo;s definitely personal. I&rsquo;ve been doing campy horror lyrics since I was 15-years-old, and I wanted to expand beyond that. For the new Murderdolls, I wanted to keep the humor and violence intact, but I wanted to show a different side of the band. I&rsquo;m singing about life this time, instead of Dracula. If you really want to get down to it, we&rsquo;re a sex-drugs-rock-n-roll band more than anything.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;Drug Me To Hell&quot; and &quot;Blood Stained Valentine&rdquo feature solos from none other than legendary M&oumltley Cr&uumle guitarist, Mick Mars. About working with Mars, Jordison states, &quot;He&rsquo;s always been my favorite member of M&oumltley Cr&uumle. He&rsquo;s just a really classy guy, and his guitar playing is so unique. We sent the songs to him, and he loved them. Before we knew it, he was in the studio tracking. The way he plays&mdashhis style&mdashis so different than anyone that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.

It is an active record.&rdquo That&rsquos how bassist Andrew &ldquoAJ&rdquo Jacobs, the sole founding member, effectively encapsulated what Mutiny Within and their self-titled debut are about. The resulting album, <em>Mutiny Within, </em>is the culmination of<em> </em>years of figuring it out, getting it together and finally making it work and it&rsquos all manifested in an album that is almost shocking in its technical prowess and its use of melody amid maelstrom.</p><br><p>Jacobs can sum up Mutiny Within&rsquos sound as &ldquoshred with clean vocals, with a little bit of screaming, metal riffs, accessible parts and a lot of melody. We wanted to get all the melody in there. That is the number one thing for us. We want the music to reach metal fans and beyond. We want to reach everyone in between.&rdquo</p><br><p>While these metal upstarts Mutiny Within may have started out as a Children of&nbsp Bodom cover band &ndash and they&rsquore not embarrassed to admit it since they did grow out of it quickly only to become their own shred-happy entity- the sextet truly stepped on the path to recognition when they started writing their own songs. With origins in the great state of New Jersey, known for producing some of the top, up and coming metal talent in recent years, Mutiny Within also demonstrated their ability to remain ahead of the curve by embracing technology (and we&rsquore not talking about the studio trickery kind) and social networking features to take their band to the next level.</p><br><p>Jacobs formed the band in 2002 and endured a turbulent yet typical early existence until he solidified the lineup. His younger brother Brandon actually plays guitar and was a mere 18-years-old when he recorded the album. Vocalist Chris Clancy was imported from England after the band discovered this talented vox over a YouTube video and now resides in New Jersey. This is a band, who with their self-titled debut, are on the verge of being the valedictorians of the <em>Guitar Hero </em>generation. They play with astonishing technical skill with a forward-thinking songwriting style that can be viewed as modernly progressive, but definitely not &ldquoprog.&rdquo The band&rsquos use of keyboards also elevates their sound above and beyond just another up and coming metal band.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe were looking for a vocalist and we saw a video of Chris singing, so we contacted him and asked him to try putting vocals over one of our songs,&rdquo Jacobs recalls. &ldquoHe was the first audition and he rocked it. It was perfect. The only problem was that he lived in England, but he took a risk, flew over and made it work. He lives in my house now.&rdquo Indeed, Mutiny Within keep things in the family, since the band practices in the basement of drummer Bill Fore, who lives a mere twenty minutes from the Jacobs&rsquo abode.</p><br><p>Once Clancy committed to making the trek across the pond- he had nothing else to lose as a 23-year-old English kid working at a T-Mobile store- this band of hungry, young turks, who play like a troupe of seasoned, shredding veterans, wrote a whopping 50 songs together, fuelling one another&rsquos creativity. The flurry of activity surrounding the band, including their enthrallingly intense live show, captured the attention of Roadrunner Records, which signed the band. After the signing, the band kept writing and eventually went to work with producer Jason Bieler. Clancy&rsquos college friend, Dan Bage, eventually joined the band in the middle of recording, which not only makes Mutiny Within an &nbspunintentionally &ldquointernational band,&rdquo but was a situation that invigorated them, too.&nbsp &ldquoDan was so good that it wasn&rsquot like we were in the middle of making the record and got a stranger,&rdquo Jacobs recalled. &ldquoIt was Chris&rsquo friend and the best guy for the job technically. He flew over, we threw him in the studio, and he did seven solos, wrote four verses and helped rewrite parts, so he is just as important to the band.&rdquo Clearly, Mutiny Within are a band that can be thrown into the crackling fires of chaotic situations and emerge stronger and more focused than before.</p><br><p>Clancy started singing when he was 15-years-old and consistently worked to hone his craft through noted vocal coach Melissa Cross, so he could truly learn to sing, which only adds to the depth of dynamics on <em>Mutiny Within. </em>He was not hesitant to abandon his native England in order to pursue his rock &lsquon roll and heavy metal dreams, either. Clancy said, &ldquoI wanted to do this since I was a kid and first started playing in bands. I got myself in a band in Wales and then I dropped my social life there and abandoned my friends to write music and to practice, but that didn&rsquot go past the interest stage, so it wasn&rsquot a hard decision to come to America. I quit the job, got on a flight and came over. I spent my life trying to be in a band. That was always my plan, so I told myself if I have to move to do it, I&rsquoll do it.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoWe have all these technical guys who can play so many types of music and have so many different tastes, so for those 50 songs, we went around the world and back,&rdquo Jacobs says.&nbsp Obviously, not all 50 songs made the cut, but the sheer numbers demonstrate the band&rsquos abilities and range. &ldquoThe 11 songs we picked for the record are our best songs,&rdquo Jacobs adds.</p><br><p>The band was introduced to the metal world in Fall 2009, via their first national tour with Soulfly, Prong and Cattle Decapitation, in addition to the dozens of local, hometown shows they&rsquove logged and tucked under their belts and will spend much of the year following the release of<em> Mutiny Within </em>touring and turning heads.</p><br>The opening track &ldquoAwake&rdquo is one which defines the band&rsquos sound, with Jacobs saying, &ldquowe get more diverse, with different keys, tempos and styles throughout, but that&rsquos the song that defines our sound.&rdquo&nbsp&nbsp &ldquoReflections&rdquo is another band favorite, thanks to its unforgettable melodies. &nbspWhile Jacobs says that &ldquoForsaken&rdquo is the song where &ldquowe stepped outside the box to show a different side of the band, with clean guitars.&rdquo<ol> </ol><br><p>It appears as though the Mutiny Within story is just beginning and that the ins and outs of their formation will lead to a happy ending. &ldquoWe dedicated our whole lives to this,&rdquo Jacobs said. &ldquoTwo guys dropped their lives in England and didn&rsquot know if it would work, since we weren&rsquot even signed at the time, but we had that dedication to do it.&rdquo<br /> <br /> Certainly, Mutiny Within aren&rsquot a traditional band, having used technology and the Internet to their benefit and thus forcing the band to work in different ways.&nbsp &ldquoMost bands get in a van, go out, play, tour, tour, tour,&rdquo Jacobs said. <br /> &ldquoWe&rsquore at that chapter now. The focus for us was always just writing songs. That&rsquos been our lives. We played 30 shows with Chris and then got signed. We made every song as special as the next. Each track has lots of time put into it. We were a band that aspired to get a deal and make records, so we made the focus of efforts the songs.&rdquo</p><br><p>Mission accomplished on <em>Mutiny Within: </em>11 songs that usher in a new generation of metal.</p>', 2010, NULL),
(27, 'Nickelback', '                             <p>&quot;We never take anything for granted,&quot; says<strong> Nickelback&rsquo;s Chad Kroeger</strong>. But this is one band that certainly could.</p><br><p>Since it rolled out of Alberta some 13 years ago, Nickelback has been hit-making, multi-platinum concern whose last album, 2005&rsquo;s <em>All The Right Reasons </em>is one of the most successful of the century, and has stoked great expectations for the quartet&rsquo;s sixth album, <strong><em>Dark Horse</em></strong>. A lesser group might rest on its proverbial laurels and assume the world is anxiously waiting for it, but Nickelback -- Kroeger, his brother and bassist <strong>Mike Kroeger</strong>, guitarist <strong>Ryan Peake</strong> and drummer <strong>Daniel Adair</strong> -- still feel like a new album is a fresh opportunity to prove themselves.</p><br><p>&quot;I honestly think that with every song you release you have to keep winning your own fans over again,&quot; Chad Kroeger explains. &quot;I want every single song to be amazing. That&rsquo;s what I want to hear, so that&rsquo;s what we have to try to provide to our fans.&quot;</p><br><p>His brother, bassist Mike Kroeger, adds that, &quot;Any artist that is even surviving right now is a dark horse because things change pretty fast. You&rsquo;re a superstar one day and wake up the next day and you&rsquo;re anonymous. To be successful in any way is beating the odds right now, I think.&quot;</p><br><p>Nickelback is well ahead of those odds, and it continues to pulverize them with <em>Dark Horse</em>, an 11-track survey of everything the group has done so well to this point -- fist-pumping anthems, grinding rockers, soaring power ballads, grinning sexual innuendo, heart-wringing romanticism, choruses that stick in your ears after the first listen and hooks so big they practically boomerang through the songs.</p><br><p>And while Mike Kroeger contends that <em>Dark Horse </em>&quot;isn&rsquo;t affecting some huge departure from our past efforts,&quot; it does find the band working in some fresh -- and rarefied -- rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll territory. It marks the first time Nickelback has worked with an outside producer since <em>Silver Side Up </em>&nbspin 2001, but considering that producer is <strong><em>Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange</em></strong>, he of AC/DC &quot;Back in Black,&quot; Def Leppard &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot; and Foreigner &quot;4&quot; fame, it&rsquo;s easy to understand why the group was willing to open up the inner sanctum again.</p><br><p>&quot;He was actually somebody we were interested in working with for a long time,&quot; notes Peake. &quot;We had to think a lot about relinquishing a bit of that control to someone else. But we just said, &rsquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s give it a shot.&rsquo; If there&rsquo;s anybody we were gonna try to work with, it would be very cool to work with somebody like (Lange), who&rsquo;s done some pretty fantastic work in the past.</p><br><p>&quot;And we knew we&rsquo;re way too headstrong to let someone else come in and make things totally different for us, no matter who they are!&quot;</p><br><p>Nickelback&rsquo;s track record certainly speaks to the group&rsquo;s stature. The group has sold 27 million albums worldwide and, since the 2001 breakthrough of &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; has sent 13 singles rocketing onto the various Billboard charts, expanding its solid foothold in rock markets to the Top 40 world.</p><br><p><em>All The Right Reasons</em> insured Nickelback an indelible place in rock history, however. It spent a staggering 112 consecutive weeks in the Top 30 of the Billboard Top 200, was certified 8-times platinum in the U.S. and has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide, topping charts in four countries. <em>All The Right Reasons </em>spun off seven multi-format singles and made Nickelback the first band in Nielsen BDS history to send five singles onto the CHR charts. All five of the album&rsquo;s videos hit No. 1 on VH1&rsquo;s playlist, while Nickelback has sold more than 9 million single digital downloads and more than 5 million ringtones of the album&rsquo;s songs. <em>All The Right Reasons</em> won the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album and helped the quartet to three Billboard Music Awards in 2006 and a pair of Juno Awards in Canada. And on the road, Nickelback has sold more than 1.65 million concert tickets over the course of the album cycle.</p><br><p>&quot;It wasn&rsquo;t like we all sat back and said, &rsquo;Oh my God, this is gonna be the biggest record of our lives,&rsquo; &quot; Chad Kroeger recalls. &quot;It was us sitting around saying, &rsquo;we&rsquo;re really proud of this record, and I hope that everyone else is gonna love it half as much as we do.&rsquo; And they did.&quot;</p><br><p><em>All The Right Reasons</em> did, however, set a high bar for <em>Dark Horse</em>, but the members of Nickelback say they felt a different kind of pressure when they sat down with Lange to start working on the new album.</p><br><p>&quot;That pressure has always been there it&rsquo;s self-imposed pressure from before we started selling records,&quot; explains Mike Kroeger. &quot;It&rsquo;s self-imposed pressure to do your best work.&quot;</p><br><p>Peake adds that, &quot;I&rsquo;ve been asked quite a bit about the pressure of a new album, and I don&rsquo;t buy into it. I didn&rsquo;t buy into it after (2001&rsquo;s six-times platinum) <em>Silver Side Up,</em> I didn&rsquo;t buy into it after (2003&rsquo;s three-times platinum) <em>Long Road </em>and I&rsquo;m not gonna buy into it again. We just have to go in, do the best to our possible abilities and leave it up to the people.&quot;</p><br><p>Work on <em>Dark Horse </em>began in March, after Nickelback made its long-awaited contact with Lange. The band traveled to the producer&rsquo;s home base in Switzerland to begin going over song ideas. The tunes came from a variety of directions for instance the dynamically swelling <strong>&quot;If Today Was Your Last Day,&quot;</strong> had been around for awhile but hadn&rsquo;t been finished. &quot;Chad brought it out of the vault and the creative juices started to flow,&quot; Mike Kroeger notes.&nbsp Then there&rsquo;s &quot;<strong>This Afternoon</strong>,&quot; whose acoustic, rootsy flavor, along with some downright country-style guitar licks represent a refreshing departure from the Nickelback norm. &quot;It&rsquo;s a big-time part of our background,&quot; Mike Kroeger notes, &quot;that whole laid-back, barroom kind of feel. Where we grew up everybody listened to country. I would say that song&rsquo;s our &rsquo;Friends In Low Places,&rsquo; y&rsquo;know?&quot;</p><br><p><em>Dark Horse&rsquo;s</em> other songs -- recorded during the summer at Chad Kroeger&rsquo;s converted barn studio in Vancouver -- traverse a wide terrain, from the arcing melodic ebb and flow of the first single, <strong>&quot;Gotta Be Somebody</strong>&quot; and the metallic groove of <strong>&quot;Burn It To The Ground&quot;</strong> to the heavy riffery of <strong>&quot;Something In Your Mouth&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;The Next Go Round&quot;</strong> and the inspiring balladry of <strong>&quot;You&rsquo;ll Never Be Alone&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;I&rsquo;d Come For You.&quot;</strong> &quot;We&rsquo;re a rock band,&quot; Peake says. &quot;We like to get heavy and we do like to write stuff that&rsquo;s melodic and maybe a little more mellow. It&rsquo;s nice to have both, and it&rsquo;s nice to have both accepted by the fans. There are some bands that can only put out one kind of thing, but our fans are pretty open so we don&rsquo;t get stuck in one place.&quot;</p><br><p>Mike Kroeger adds that, &quot;I think people expect that level of effort or level of &rsquo;quality&rsquo; from us. We don&rsquo;t pen ourselves into one identity we&rsquo;re just trying out new things and doing some things we haven&rsquo;t done before...and making sure that it&rsquo;s as good as it can be and the cleanest and most refined version of what we do.&quot;</p><br><p>That&rsquo;s what comes honestly for Nickelback, And it seems to work time and again.</p><br><p>&quot;We&rsquo;re kind of a people&rsquo;s band,&quot; Peake explains, &quot;so we&rsquo;ll leave it up to them whether they like it or not. We&rsquo;re one of those bands people come back to, which is very cool.&quot;</p><br><p>Even when it&rsquo;s applied to a self-declared, multi-platinum dark horse.</p>', 2000, NULL),
(28, 'Nightwish', '                               <p>Equal parts epic metal and gothic symphony, <strong>Nightwish </strong>stand alone. They blend soaring keyboards and operatic vocals with shredding guitars and jagged rhythms for a style of cinematic, orchestral heavy music all their own.&nbsp The Finnish quintet has remained a force in the European scene for the last decade, but with their second <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong> release <strong><em>Dark Passion Play</em></strong>, they are destined to captivate metal fans across the entire globe.&nbsp Filling vocalist Tarja Turunen&#39s vacant spot with newcomer <strong>Anette Olzon</strong>, the band is now stronger than ever. They have also crafted a record that&#39s heavy, hypnotic and downright powerful.</p>    <p>Nightwish&#39s style has established them as one of the premier female-fronted metal bands. With overpowering keyboard tones reminiscent of classic film scores, the band separates itself. Their combination of seductive, emotional vocals and gallant guitar melodies brings to mind both Evanescence and Iced Earth. Yet, Nightwish have crafted a distinct sound. Their 1997 debut <em>Angels Fall Fast</em> introduced the world to this sound, propelled by the strength of the single &quotThe Carpenter.&quot The follow-up <em>Oceanborn</em> would secure a spot in the Finnish Top Five and spawn three chart-topping singles.&nbsp In 2000, <em>Wishmaster </em>cemented the band&#39s rabid fan following and led to their first U.S. distribution. However, a hard-hitting fourth offering <em>Century Child</em> added bassist and backing vocalist <strong>Marco Hietela</strong> to the fold, and it yielded some of the band&#39s heaviest and darkest tracks up to that point. Nightwish embraced their metallic and classical influences to the fullest and completely established themselves.</p>    <p>In 2004, the band&#39s first Roadrunner Records release and fifth studio effort <strong><em>Once</em></strong><em> </em>would gain them a foothold in the U.S.&nbsp They launched a hotly-anticipated tour in The States, packing sold-out theaters across the country. Over the course of the year, <em>Once </em>surpassed sales of one million units worldwide.&nbsp The album featured the single <strong>&quotNemo,&quot</strong> with an entrancing video courtesy of director <strong>Antti Jokinen</strong> (Eminem). <em>Once </em>eventually garnered the band five awards at the <strong>Finnish Grammy Awards</strong> including both <strong>&quotBand of the Year&quot</strong> and <strong>&quotThe Best Selling Album of the Year.&quot</strong>&nbsp These accolades would solidify Nightwish as an international force.</p>    <p>After a highly successful world tour in 2005, the band underwent a drastic lineup change. They severed ties with Tarja via an open letter. Fans and the media clamored for a replacement, and questions ran rampant. Though most artists might not be able to recover from a split like this, Nightwish aren&#39t most artists. The band would check out over 2,000 applications from singers worldwide until they found Anette Olzon. Upon her first visit to Finland, Anette met the band and immediately clicked with them. They announced her addition shortly after. The sexy Swedish singer elevates Nightwish to the next level with a dynamic voice that breathes charisma and life into the new songs. </p>      <p>Even with the absence of Tarja, Nightwish has crafted an epic, infectious and potent sixth release in the form of <strong><em>Dark Passion Play</em></strong>. <strong>Tuomas Holopainen&#39s</strong> keys create huge melodies that are deep, gothic and sensual, while <strong>Emppu Vuorinen&#39s</strong> guitars hit with an urgent crunch. The record represents the culmination of the band&#39s evolution and success. It&#39s a dark, yet infectious journey, featuring all of the elements that fans love about Nightwish-from the symphonic keyboards to the divine melodies. At the forefront of the new music is Anette.&nbsp Her voice hypnotizes with a diverse range, complementing both the metallic guitars and orchestral keys perfectly. The new songs are some of Nightwish&#39s most adventurous and powerful. Leadoff single <strong>&quotBye Bye Beautiful&quot</strong> starts with a precise, calculated riff locked in with warm electronic keys. Then the song launches into vibrant vocal interplay between Anette and Marco with an incendiary and catchy chorus. <strong>&quot7 Days to the Wolves&quot</strong> features galloping guitars with swirling orchestrations and visual lyrics that captivate.&nbsp On <strong>&quotMaster Passion Greed,&quot</strong> epic riffs and keyboards create an inviting, yet intense embrace.&nbsp Heavy guitars crescendo into an incredible vocal explosion.&nbsp Meanwhile, <strong>&quotAmaranth&quot</strong> has a power metal rhythm that builds with a serious urgency. </p>  <p>However, Nightwish have further experimented, embracing their new singer&#39s immense talent and venturing beyond the norm. &quotEva&quot highlights Anette&#39s versatility, allowing her voice to take center stage and simply soar. The ballad showcases ethereal keyboards and a hauntingly gorgeous chorus. </p>    <p>Ultimately, Nightwish have made a career out of breaking the rules.&nbsp Their sound could never simply be categorized, and they have managed to continually evolve with each album. With their first U.S. tour with Anette this fall and <em>Dark Passion Play</em> out October 2<sup>nd</sup>, Nightwish are bound to secure their spot at the top.</p>    ', 2004, NULL),

But along with their technical prowess and world-wearied outlook, the Central Jersey quintet has a significant tell &ndash the careful optimism and sheer energy of the young.  <strong>The Parlor Mob</strong>&rsquos debut album <em>And You Were A Crow</em> bears all the noise and lessons of the past several years for the band. It&rsquos a record constructed out of the most raw materials the grit and transience of rented apartments and borrowed garages, major label hardship, and the fierce brotherhood that has kept the band together through it all. <br /><br /> Finally, however, the hardships the band has suffered appear to be paying off. In addition to the brilliant debut the band has to show for their years together, they&rsquove embarked on their first headlining tour, after consistently selling out rooms in their native New Jersey and New York. &ldquoHeadlining is such a different animal,&rdquo explains bassist Nick Villapiano. &ldquoWe&rsquo;re so used to having thirty or forty minutes to try and grab new fans. Now we have a nice time slot to get thoroughly into our songs.&rdquo But new fans haven&rsquot been difficult for the rock outfit to come by lately -- iTunes just named them Best New Artist of 2008 in the rock genre, and since last year&rsquos Lollapalooza performance, the band has steadily been growing their already significant fanbase. &ldquoIt was amazing,&rdquo says guitarist Paul Ritchie of their performance at last year&rsquos festival. &ldquoIt was the highlight of all of our careers, I&rsquod have to say.&rdquo <br /><br /> Until now that is. Just before embarking on their TK-date tour, the band wrapped the video for first single &ldquoHard Times,&rdquo a chugging, guitar-driven song that rips the album open with lead singer Mark Melicia&rsquos signature moan. More swagger than self-pity, the band decided to showcase what they do best in the video. &ldquo[It]&rsquos performance-based,&rdquo says guitarist Paul Ritchie. &ldquoWe wanted to showcase our strength, which is performing. We wouldn&rsquot want a cheesy storyline to go along with it.&rdquo But the band&rsquos distaste for cheesiness doesn&rsquot mean they&rsquore short on sentiment. The song, a prescient political take on the state affairs, is more swagger than self-pity, and its universality is undeniable. Rarely has a generation&rsquos problems been put so succinctly, and so head-noddingly, into song.<br /><br /> All the setbacks the band sustained to make <em>And You Were A Crow</em> proved necessary to making the album. After an initial major label deal fell through, the band threw themselves into their work. &ldquoWe have a basic gameplan,&rdquo Villapiano continues. &ldquoWe perpetually write. More than anything, it&rsquos a way of therapy, a way to keep us on track.&rdquo Where a lesser band may have retreated to day jobs and eventual nostalgia, <strong>The Parlor Mob</strong> &ndash named for a group of 19th century mercenaries used in New York City riots &ndash channeled their misfortune into their art. <br /><br /> Showcasing the depth of their influences, the band offers up twelve varied tracks with <em>And You Were A Crow</em>, each plumbing one of the many emotions brought on by the events of the band&rsquos five-year history. The epic, emotive &ldquoTide of Tears&rdquo makes use of Melicia&rsquos heart-rending scream amidst dredging guitars and a buoying piano, while elsewhere his smooth croon laces acoustic shuffler &ldquoAngry Young Girl.&rdquo The soulful sway of &ldquoWhen I Was An Orphan,&rdquo says guitarist Dave Rosen, is an expansion of the band&rsquos sound. &ldquoTo me, it&rsquos darker and bigger and heavier. [These songs] don&rsquot sound like a band that&rsquos trying to find itself.&rdquo<br /><br /> Recorded in Echo Mountain Recording Studios in Asheville, North Carolina, the band worked with producer Jacquire King (Kings of Leon, Modest Mouse), who sought out the band&rsquos new record company to work with them. &ldquoWhat sold us on him was his desire to do the majority of the record based on our live performance in the studio. And that&rsquos basically what it is,&rdquo says Ritchie.&nbsp King, infused the album with the camaraderie the band has in abundance. On &ldquoCan&rsquot Keep No Good Boy Down,&rdquo King suggested the band give some indication of the time they were having. &ldquoWe wanted to get a little ambient stuff going on &ndash it&rsquos a redemptive song, so have some chatter and indication that we were having a good time. So we mic&rsquoed the live room where we were recording, brought up some cases of beers and tequila, and recorded the room and talk,&rdquo says Villapiano.<br /><br /> The moods evoked through the symbiosis of music and lyrics make <em>And You Were A Crow</em> a visceral journey, at times deep and dark, and at times thrashing good fun. It&rsquos a time capsule of the lives of five individuals, of place and time. Above all, it&rsquos a testament to the redemptive power of rock and roll for this generation. &ldquoOur story and our outlook are pretty self-explanatory,&rdquo says Villapiano. &ldquoJust a bunch of friends who really love music, really love each other, and are trying our best to share what we&rsquove got with as many people as we can.&rdquo', 2008, NULL),

Then there are the rare exceptions &ndash like <strong>Ratt</strong>.</p><br><p>As the story goes, Ratt helped pioneer Hollywood&rsquos legendary Sunset Strip sound and scene.&nbsp The band has returned sounding fired up and better than ever. Ratt&rsquos first studio album in 11 years, <strong><em>Infestation</em></strong>, is a return to their heavy, riff driven roots.&nbsp The band has reinvented their sound by rediscovering their strengths, shuttling listeners to a time when metal ruled the earth and real musicians wore eyeliner like a badge of honor.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe wanted this to be like something that we would have written right after [1984&rsquos] <em>Out of the Cellar</em>, says vocalist <strong>Stephen Pearcy</strong>. &ldquoWe definitely went back to basics with the mindset of a band with a lot of excitement and some great songs to get out.&rdquo</p><br><p>Right out of the box, <em>Infestation</em> ignites like gasoline to an open flame, bursting with an energy and attitude absent from metal for years, unheard, perhaps, since before the dawn of DVDs, grunge and Facebook. Album opener &ldquoEat Me Up Alive&rdquo slaps you in the face with attitude and a timeless riff that has been a staple in Ratt&rsquos music and has set them apart from the pack.&nbsp From the strip pole gyrations of &ldquoLook Out Below&rdquo to the keg party anthem &ldquoTake a Big Bite,&rdquo <em>Infestation</em> rages with a life and energy that Ratt is famous for.</p><br><p>Yet <em>Infestation</em> is more than a party album. While the music is a glorious celebration throughout, some of the lyrics are serious and sobering, weighing the benefits of monogamy versus the thrill of rampant hedonism without being preachy or judgmental. On &ldquoTake Me Home,&rdquo Pearcy declares, &ldquoI&rsquoll tell you a little secret that you need to know/ you&rsquore always in my heart, always in my soul.&rdquo Then, in &ldquoGarden of Eden,&rdquo his alter ego brags: &ldquoI got a bad reputation and you knew it so well/ yeah, I&rsquoll give you what you need/I&rsquom gonna take you to hell.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoI was not in that good of a place emotionally when we were writing this record,&rdquo admits Pearcy. &ldquoSure there are sexual innuendos and party stuff, but there are also songs that deal with some very real issues. The lyrics meant so much to me that every morning for weeks prior to recording, I would wake up and rewrite. It was a strange process for me, but it worked.&rdquo</p><br><p>Ratt started writing <em>Infestation</em> in January 2009, and by April they had 20 new songs, which they refined with producer <strong>Michael &ldquoElvis&rdquo Baskette</strong> (Chevelle, Alter Bridge). But before they could even start the shiny metal wheels rolling, they had to secure their lineup and repair years of enmity that developed when Pearcy abruptly quit for personal reasons in 1999. It was a rough era for Ratt. Pearcy was replaced by vocalist Jizzy Pearl and John Corabi took the second guitar slot, replacing original axeman Robbin Crosby.<em> </em></p><br><p>Founding drummer<strong> Bobby Blotzer</strong> and bassist <strong>Robbie Crane</strong>, who has been a mainstay and driving force in the band since 1996, remained constant, though while Ratt worked hard in the early &lsquo90s, they purposely stayed on the road and out of the studio.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe decided not to pursue recording a Ratt record when Stephen was out of the band<em>,&rdquo </em>says guitarist <strong>Warren DeMartini</strong>. &ldquoWe definitely wanted to retain that same lineup for a long time, but life comes along and changes those plans. Stephen quit the band, and we didn&rsquot want that to mean the end of Ratt.&rdquo</p><br><p>After some serious discussions, Pearcy rejoined and in 2007, DeMartini, Pearcy, Blotzer and Crane took the stage together for the first time in eight years, playing over 50 dates<em>,</em> and releasing the best of CD <em>Tell the World: The Very Best of Ratt</em>. Also, they released their first ever DVD <em>RATT Videos from the Cellar: The Atlantic Years</em>. The shows were a telling precursor of what was to come.</p><br><p>&ldquoThat <em>tour</em> was really exciting and refreshing because the sound was back, and even better,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoStephen had grown, we had grown, and with those pieces restored, we knew we could get back to writing.&rdquo</p><br><p>With a bunch of shows under their belts, Ratt were eager to get back into the cellar and write some new songs, but they wanted to add to their lineup. DeMartini suggested ex-Quiet Riot guitarist <strong>Carlos Cavazo</strong> to round out the lineup. Cavazo, a well known, accomplished lead player gives Ratt the twin-guitar attack and credibility they had in the early days with Crosby.</p><br><p>&ldquoI thought of bringing in Carlos a couple years before it actually happened,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoAt the time, we thought we were going to be replacing John because of conflicting schedules and I started thinking it would be cool to have Carlos. So when the time was right, he was the first person I called.&rdquo</p><br><p>For Cavazo, who was between projects the offer came at a perfect time. And since he already knew the guys in Ratt from the early days, he felt comfortable with the personalities of the players.</p><br><p>&ldquoIt worked out great for me and felt very natural,&rdquo Cavazo says. &ldquoIt&rsquos funny because I was just hanging out in my house one day and I missed a call. So I checked my voice mail and noticed it was Warren. The first thing I&rsquom thinking is, &lsquoEither there&rsquos a big party he&rsquos going to invite me to somewhere, or they&rsquore looking for a new guitar player.&rsquo Obviously, it was the latter.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoIt&rsquos great to be able to do the more exotic double lead stuff that I<em> </em>did back in the day with Robbin,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoI wanted someone I could collaborate with and someone who could sing well, so Carlos worked out on all levels.&rdquo</p><br><p>Ratt flew to a remote area of Virginia Beach in spring 2009 to work on new songs. They stayed in a four bedroom house there and wrote on their own schedule, banging out riff after riff and molding them into tunes quickly and with great enthusiasm.</p><br><p>&ldquoWe wanted go off the beaten path on this one and set up somewhere we could eat, sleep and create the album in the same place,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoIt was great fun we had the camaraderie of a road trip together with the environment to really stay focused.&rdquo</p><br><p>While DeMartini, Cavazo, Crane and drummer Bobby Blotzer finessed the music, Pearcy stayed in his room and worked on his lyrics<em>. </em></p><br><p>&ldquoIt was exciting because none of us knew how the melody and the lyrics would work with the songs until Stephen finally brought us his part,&rdquo Blotzer says. &ldquoThe outcome was surprising in a good way.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoIt was great that we had those writing sessions together,&rdquo Pearcy adds. &ldquoSome of my parts were written right then and there in the studio in preproduction. That hadn&rsquot happened since &lsquo83 and &lsquo84. One of these songs, &ldquoGarden of Eden,&rdquo was just a riff idea, but then in preproduction Warren just started playing this riff and I went, &lsquoWhat is that? I like it. Keep that. Work on that.&rsquo And we worked it out that day.&rdquo</p><br><p>As Ratt worked out their ideas in preproduction, Baskette recorded their jam session on two-inch analog tape, much of the same equipment the band had used in the &lsquo80s. In addition, he employed numerous modern studio techniques to capture the sound the band was after. Baskette also helped Ratt hone good ideas into great songs and gave the musicians the liberty to let fly with whatever creative ideas they had.</p><br><p>&ldquoI was very focused on playing harder and more outside the constraints that I had on previous Ratt records,&rdquo Blotzer says. &ldquoAnd I was really given the key to do that from the band and from Elvis.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoIt was great for Carlos and me as well because Elvis was a guitarist in a band before he was a producer, and he&rsquos real into tones,&rdquo DeMartini says. &ldquoHe was coming from the same place guitar-wise as us<em>,</em> which isn&rsquot always the case.&rdquo</p><br><p>The cumulative playing, recording and circumstantial synergy shines throughout <em>Infestation</em>. The first single &ldquoBest of Me&rdquo is a feast of foot-to-the floor dynamics that features gritty vocals that uncurl like a coiled snake into a glorious chorus, and guitar lines as memorable as a dirty limerick. &ldquoGarden of Eden&rdquo builds from a bluesy intro into a pounding gallop, and shifts into a surging stop-start sky-puncher at the midpoint. But maybe it&rsquos a line in the mid-paced &ldquoAs Good as it Gets&rdquo that most accurately sums up the approach, attitude and conviction of <em>Infestation</em>: &ldquoYou get just what you came for.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoOur music is like it was in the beginning it means everything to us,&rdquo Pearcy says. &ldquoAnd here we are 25 years later, keeping Ratt N&rsquo Roll alive.&rdquo</p><br><p>&ldquoWhen we play concerts now, there&rsquos a new generation.&nbsp We&rsquore seeing kids of people who grew up with us, but the reaction is the same,&rdquo adds DeMartini. &ldquoIt doesn&rsquot seem to matter where we are in the world.&rdquo &nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p>', 2010, NULL),
(36, 'ROADRUNNER UNITED THE CONCERT', '                             It was a &quot;You had to be there&quot; event. A concert during which 39 musicians, representing 25 different Roadrunner bands, performing 25 songs from 19 different bands&rsquo repertoire. This unique and unprecedented aggregation of musicians was no jam session. Each song was studiously rehearsed and arranged and came together in exuberant perfection. By the time everything was said and done, it was one helluva a party. <br /><br />Now it&rsquo;s time for the DVD that captured it all. <br /><br />Roadrunner Records&rsquo; 25th anniversary celebration, held on Thursday, December 15, 2005 at New York City&rsquo;s Nokia Theater, was a night to remember. For those who experienced the event first hand, it was a once-in-a-lifetime party and concert where artists that spanned the label&rsquo;s history, as well as artist and industry friends, converged to toast all things Roadrunner. The party was held in conjunction with the landmark <strong><em>Roadrunner United The All-Star Sessions</em></strong> album, released two months prior. <br /><br />Almost three years to the day later, Roadrunner is releasing a DVD that chronicles an evening of raised metal horns, dubbed <strong><em>Roadrunner United The Concert</em></strong>, a two-disc set that captures the festive intensity of the night. The concert enjoyed a cult, &quot;You had to be there!&quot; status in the metal and hard rock scenes and now Roadrunner is giving the label&rsquo;s diehard followers a chance to witness the event themselves.<br /><br />Throughout its rich and impressive history, Roadrunner Records has been destined for greatness, evolving from a small Dutch licensing label into one of the most innovative record labels in the world. Fiercely independent since its start, Roadrunner has achieved something that many labels seek and never attain, let alone maintain for a quarter-century: brand recognition. The Roadrunner logo has come to mean two things to millions of fans around the world: a high standard of quality in musicianship and presentation and an unwavering commitment to the best, most unique and intense in the hard rock and heavy metal genres. <br /><br />In 2005, in typical Roadrunner fashion, the label devised a brilliantly inventive way to celebrate its milestone 25th anniversary. Paying homage to its past, giving a nod to its future and framing both in the most creative terms possible, Roadrunner released an album of original new heavy music, played by some of the genre&rsquo;s best and most highly-regarded practitioners. <br /><br />&ldquoRoadrunner&rsquo;s owner, Cees Wessels, asked me to come up with an idea to celebrate Roadrunner&rsquo;s 25th anniversary,&rdquo recalls A&ampR visionary Monte Conner. &ldquoI knew that for it to be really special, we would need to come up with a record that involved many musicians, one that was truly a collaboration on a grand scale, an album that would cover the entire history of Roadrunner and feature some of our most legendary artists from the past, right up to and including musicians from our newest signings.&rdquo <br /><br />The idea was mathematical from the get-go and was formulated to create four &ldquoteams&rdquo -- each headed by a &ldquoteam captain.&rdquo Each team would consist of a core of musicians who would lay down basic tracks for four original songs written by the team captain. Each song would use a different vocalist, and no player could appear on a tune by another team. The four captains -- <strong>Slipknot</strong> drummer Joey Jordison, <strong>Machine Head</strong> frontman Robb Flynn, former<strong> Fear Factory</strong> guitarist Dino Cazares and <strong>Trivium</strong> vocalist Matthew K. Heafy &ndash assembled their songs and their musicians for an album that was released in October 2005. An astounding total of 56 musicians from 44 different bands were assembled in an amazing organizational feat and a sign of the respect and that each player had for each other and the label itself. <br /><br />Furthermore, those same artists, and then some, continued to pay their respects to Roadrunner for the <strong>Roadrunner United</strong> concert! Most of the musicians that performed on the album trekked to NYC for the party and performance. Many artists from Roadrunner&rsquo;s history who weren&rsquo;t even on the <strong><em>Roadrunner United The All-Star Sessions</em></strong> album were in attendance. Musicians who were friends of the label also agreed to lend their talents to the performance. The core &quot;house&quot; band consisted of <strong>Slipknot&rsquo;s </strong>Joey Jordison and Paul Gray, <strong>Machine Head&rsquo;s</strong> Adam Duce, <strong>Sepultura&rsquo;s</strong> Andreas Kisser, <strong>Soulfly&rsquo;s</strong> and <strong>Stone Sour&rsquo;s</strong> Roy Mayorga, <strong>Fear Factory&rsquo;s</strong> Dino Cazares, who throughout the evening,  were joined by a jaw-dropping, rotating cast of performers. <br /><br />Some of the evening&rsquo;s highlights included <strong>Slipknot&rsquo;s</strong> Corey Taylor singing while perched atop the shoulders of  <strong>Killswitch Engage&rsquo;s</strong> Howard Jones. Former <strong>Killswitch Engage</strong> vocalist Jesse Leach reunited with his former band for a rendition of &quot;My Last Serenade.&quot; Other gems included an animated performance by <strong>Shadows Fall&rsquo;s</strong> Brian Fair, a &quot;F** Monte Conner&quot; chant, Taylor performing &quot;Bother&quot; with <strong>Life of Agony&rsquo;s</strong> Keith Caputo, and Taylor watching Flynn perform one of <strong>Slipknot&rsquo;s</strong> songs. <br /><br />The double-disc set features the concert footage as well as a second disc, a 75-minute documentary, complete with interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, making the festivities that much more intimate for the viewer.<br /><br />Among the performers were: Steve Asheim, Matt Baumbach, Corey Beaulieu, Glenn Benton, Rob Caggiano, Keith Caputo, Dino Cazares, Mike D&rsquo;Antonio, Phil Demmel, Adam Duce, Brian Fair, Robb Flynn, Justin Foley, Paul Gray, Billy Graziadei, Paolo Gregoletto, Matthew K. Heafy, Andols Herrick, Scott Ian, Jamey Jasta, Howard Jones, Joey Jordison, Andreas, Kisser, Jesse Leach, Logan Mader, Roy Mayorga, James Murphy, Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, Nadja Puelen, Evan Seinfeld, Acey Slade, Travis Smith, Joel Stroetzel, Corey Taylor, Ville Valo, Tommy Vext, Jeff Waters, Jordan Whelan and Tim Williams.<br /> <br />Indeed, heavy metal history was made on December 15, 2005.

(37, 'Rob Zombie', '                             <p>A music artist and auteur filmmaker with shrewd insight and unlimited vision, <strong>Rob Zombie</strong> has continuously challenged audiences as he stretches the boundaries of film, music and publishing. He&rsquos not happy merely sporting a single creative hat instead, he submerges himself fully in each artistic endeavor, rolling up his sleeves and immersing his hands completely in each project. That&rsquos the long and short of the artist known as Rob Zombie.</p><br><p>But perhaps the arena in which Rob Zombie is best known and most celebrated for is his music. He is a 7 time Grammy-nominated recording artist, having sold over fifteen million albums worldwide to date. Late 2009 brings Zombie to a new home at <strong>Loud&ampProud/Roadrunner Records</strong>, with a new album, the long awaited <strong><em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2</em></strong>, due out February 2, 2010.</p><br><p>The demons were let loose on <em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2,</em> which comes a dozen years after its predecessor, <em>Hellbilly Deluxe, </em>the album that established Zombie as a solo artist in his own right following the demise of White Zombie. That album also yielded a string of successful radio singles, namely &ldquoDragula&rdquo and &ldquoLiving Dead Girl,&rdquo both of which dominated the airwaves in 1998 and 1999, closing out the decade, Zombie style.</p><br><p>Well, it&rsquos a new decade (and a new millennium, not to mention) and <em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2 </em>picks up where its predecessor left off. Even though there were two studio albums -2001&rsquos <em>The Sinister Urge</em> and 2006&rsquos <em>Educated </em>Horses&mdashin between the <em>Hellbilly </em>bookends, only an artist of Zombie&rsquos caliber, however, can make the jump so seamlessly with <em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2, </em>which features the infectious single, <strong>&ldquoSick Bubblegum,&rdquo</strong> which sounds like it was written during the original&rsquos sessions, but remains modern, relevant and forward-thinking. <strong>&ldquoWhat?&rdquo</strong> is a catchy, distorted track that screams of signature Zombie, the one his throng of fans knows and loves. <strong>&ldquoWerewolf, Baby!&rdquo</strong> is another sick &lsquon twisted rock &lsquon roll anthem, while other electric romps like <strong>&ldquoJesus Frankenstein&rdquo</strong> and the thunderous <strong>&ldquoMars Needs Women&rdquo</strong>&nbsp are vintage Zombie featuring ass-moving grooves piled on&nbsp a storm of chunky riffs. <em>Hellbilly Deluxe</em> 2 is Rob Zombie in 2010: leaner and meaner, with the same snarl and appreciation for all things dark and a little bit dastardly. It&rsquos no easy feat to record a companion-style follow-up 10 years later, but Rob Zombie makes it look and sound easy. <strong></strong></p><br><p>&ldquoThis was one of the least stressful records I&rsquove ever made. The songs fell together in record time. &rdquo says Zombie, &ldquoFor some reason the best songs always come easy.&rdquo</p><br><p>Not content to merely arrest the world with his delightfully nefarious tunes, Rob Zombie directed the second edition of the Halloween franchise,<em> Halloween 2</em> for Dimension Films, which came out in August 2009. It was his fifth time writing and directing a feature film. Zombie had also interpreted John Carpenter&rsquos original cult horror film <em>Halloween </em>in 2007 that film premiered &nbspat number one at the box office, &nbspbreaking all Labor Day Weekend 2007 records and grossing an estimated 80 million dollars worldwide. His efforts on rebooting and reinventing this beloved franchise earned him two nominations from Spike TV&rsquos Scream Awards, for Best Director and Best Remake he picked up the award for the latter. &nbspHis previous films include 2004&rsquos <em>House of 1000 Corpses </em>and 2005&rsquos critically acclaimed <em>The Devil&rsquos Rejects </em>also a Spike Award winner<em>. </em>Zombie wrapped production on his animated, R-rated feature, <em>The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, </em>which is now available on DVD.</p><br><p>For the past two decades Zombie has directed dozens of videos, having lensed tracks for fellow metal superstar Ozzy Osbourne, among others. He contributes material to soundtracks and isn&rsquot afraid to push boundaries and ignore the parameters when it comes to the both the audio and visual mediums. He won the 1995 MTV Music Video Award for White Zombie&rsquos &lsquoMore Human Than Human,&rsquo making history by becoming the first self-directed artist to pick up the award.</p><br><p>In fall 2009, Zombie kicked off the &lsquoHellbilly Deluxe 2 Tour,&rdquo where he was accompanied by his longtime bandmates: guitarist John 5, bassist Piggy D and drummer Tommy Clufetos.&nbsp &ldquoI am bouncing off the walls like a mental patient,&rdquo Zombie said about the tour. &ldquoThat tells me it&rsquos time to take it to the stage and let the demons loose.&rdquo&nbsp Zombie will continue to tour following the album&rsquos release.</p><br><p>When it comes to any artistic feat or endeavor, leave it to Rob Zombie to accomplish what appears on paper to be nearly impossible. Armed with <em>Hellbilly Deluxe 2, </em>this artist is once again about to swoop down and capture the hearts of hard rockers the world over.</p>', 2010, NULL),

(42, 'Slipknot', '                             <strong>Slipknot</strong> singer Corey Taylor knew his band was destined for greatness. He also knew that it wouldn&rsquo;t come easy.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;When we were starting out, we had all these strikes against us,&quot; he says. &quot;We were from Iowa, there were nine of us, we wore masks, we wore coveralls, we played metal. Hard metal.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;It was tough getting people to come out to Des Moines,&quot; adds bassist Paul Gray. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know why, it&rsquo;s a pretty cool place. But A&ampR dudes -- jaded folks from Los Angeles or New York -- it&rsquo;s hard to get them to come to Iowa.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;And then there were all the haters,&quot; says Taylor.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Ah, the haters. The people who liked nothing more than to give the band flack for its look, for substituting numbers for names, for putting on a show full of over-the-top chaos and unmitigated mayhem. Some of the comments came from the usual assortment of web sites and so-called music critics. But, surprisingly, &quot;we also took a lot of shit from other bands,&quot; says guitarist James Root. &quot;When we hit the road with Ozzfest in 1999, I heard a lot of condescending remarks from other musicians. They were saying, &rsquo;Slipknot won&rsquo;t sell enough records, they won&rsquo;t survive, they&rsquo;ve got too many people, nobody&rsquo;s gonna get it, they&rsquo;re all about image.&rsquo; &quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;The joke&rsquo;s on them,&quot; says Taylor with wicked glee. &quot;Our music stood up. We&rsquo;re much more popular now and it wasn&rsquo;t because of our image. It was the music.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Now, most of the bands who turned slagging <strong>Slipknot</strong> into an extreme sport have fallen off the face of the earth. The &rsquo;Knot, on the other hand, have spent nearly a decade cementing their place as one of hard rock&rsquos most extreme acts. They&rsquo;ve dropped three albums and two DVDs, all of which went Platinum or better. They&rsquo;ve sold out festivals and tours around the globe. And they are preparing to release their fourth record, All Hope Is Gone. <br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br /><strong>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Slipknot</strong> -- which features DJ Sid Wilson (0), drummer Joey Jordison (1), Gray (2), percussionist Chris Fehn (3) Root (4), sampler Craig Jones - 133 (5), percussionist M. Shawn Crahan - Clown (6), guitarist Mick Thomson (7) and Taylor (8), -- is still heavy, still enamored of great, big walls of deeply textured layers of sound. But this time, they&rsquo;ve approached their music with an eye towards stylistic expression that completely invalidates any and all comments about heavy metal clich&eacutes. Moreover, they&rsquo;ve continued the exploration of melody that began on their first record. &nbsp<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Songs like &quot;Sulfur&quot; and &quot;Psychosocial&quot; deliver crushing verses and bridges, but then explode into soaring choruses that provide a powerful showcase for Taylor&rsquo;s voice. The song &quot;Vendetta&quot; features a sleazy, rough-and-tumble kind of swagger, but still delivers Slipknot&rsquo;s trademark balls-out fury. And &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; just spews raw anger, aggression, hate and foulness that serves as a reminder to anyone still stupid enough to harbor doubts that Slipknot are experts at delivering pure, heavy-metal punishment.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;It&rsquo;s our fourth album, and we wanted to do something different,&quot; says Gray. &quot;You can&rsquo;t put out the same record over and over again. At the same time, you can definitely still tell that this is <strong>Slipknot</strong>.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;I&rsquo;m looking forward to the expressions on people&rsquo;s faces when they hear the new record,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;There&rsquo;s very, very heavy stuff on this album, and it&rsquo;s gonna blow people&rsquo;s minds. But I&rsquo;m also excited for them to see the stuff that&rsquo;s different on this album, the more experimental music. No one&rsquo;s going to expect it.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Much of the album&rsquo;s diversity comes from the band&rsquo;s new approach to writing and recording. Over the years, most of the members have worked on various side projects, none of which sound remotely like Slipknot. It&rsquo;s no surprise to find out that these efforts influenced the writing process. Perhaps even more importantly, All Hope Is Gone was the first album on which contributions came from nearly all the band members, with each person bringing his own unique voice to the mix.&nbsp The band co-produced the album with Dave Fortman.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;I think everyone just went in with an open mind. We would always listen to everyone&rsquo;s ideas, and if they worked, they worked, if they didn&rsquo;t, they didn&rsquo;t,&quot; explains Gray. &quot;This time, we really tried to build off the ideas, really tried to work on them.&nbsp I think it helped that so many of us were able to spend time doing our own thing, too.&nbsp Just writing with different people really makes a difference in how you think about music. When we finally came together, we were able to bring that to the mix.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br /><strong>Slipknot</strong> also made the executive decision to abandon Los Angeles, where they had recorded previous records. Instead, they came back home and set up camp in <em><strong>Iowa</strong></em>. The differences were immediately apparent.<br /><br />&ldquoIt gave us more time and energy to experiment in the studio.&nbsp&nbsp I was able to come up with more guitar sounds than ever,&rdquo says Root.<br /><br />While the heart of <strong>Slipknot</strong> remains its music, its soul is planted firmly on stage. Today, <strong>Slipknot</strong> are playing in sold-out arenas, but the band developed their talents by slogging it out in the Midwest, playing any show they could find. These were frequently one-off shows the band would travel from their hometown of Des Moines to places like Omaha&nbsp and Chicago. &quot;There were never any actual tours in those days,&quot; says Thomson. &quot;Our shows were like sporting events: We&rsquod put everything into them and then afterwards, we&rsquo;d be fucking exhausted. We weren&rsquo;t going to pile into a van -- all nine of us -- and then drive all night to the next show. We&rsquo;d have fallen asleep at the wheel and died.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Those early shows were rough, but I loved the small stage,&quot; says Gray. &quot;There was something intimate about it.&nbsp It was like an old-school punk show, which is what I grew up with.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;I don&rsquo;t miss that shit at all,&quot; disagrees Thomson. &quot;It was 8,000 degrees, you&rsquo;re bumping into people, you&rsquo;re tripping over equipment. Those small stages have low ceilings, so the heat&rsquo;s trapped real low -- right at your head. Those shows are about survival, not about playing.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />As difficult as those early shows were for the band, they were just as challenging for whoever might be standing in the front row. &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Shawn used to bring chop saws on stage to grind pipes for sparks,&quot; remembers Thomson. &quot;Once, a chunk broke off and sent a kid to the hospital.&nbsp But people who got hurt at our shows were cool about it -- we&rsquo;d follow them to the hospital and sign some shirts and shit. It was like, you know, no harm, no foul.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Everyone tried to control us, though,&quot; says Taylor.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Yeah, those fuckers,&quot; says Thomson. &quot;We&rsquo;d be on tour and fire marshals would show up with camcorders and accuse us of all kinds of crazy bullshit. They&rsquo;d say, &rsquo;We heard you set yourselves on fire.&rsquo; <br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Well&hellip okay, we&rsquo;d done that!&quot; Thomson continues, laughing. &quot;Sid and Clown would spray each other with lighter fluid and then they&rsquo;d pull out lighters. That got us in trouble. One promoter would call the next -- they&rsquo;d warn each other and they&rsquo;d hit us with &rsquo;do not&rsquo; lists. We were castrated.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Surviving for 10 years is an accomplishment for any band. With <strong>Slipknot</strong>, it feels like some sort of miracle. Personalities frequently collide, side-projects abound, and on-stage fights are common. And yet, year after year, album after album, all nine men keep coming back for more. &quot;We&rsquo;re banded together in hate,&quot; says Jordison. &quot;Sometimes we hate each other, sometimes we hate the world, sometimes we just hate our own lives. But when we get together, something monstrous happens and we pull this amazing sound out of all that energy.<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;Plus,&quot; he adds, &quot;we believe in world domination, and this is the band that&rsquo;s gonna get us there.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;You know, we went from being some local band in a basement to selling millions of records,&quot; says Gray. &quot;It&rsquo;s going to be a decade since the first album came out. I&rsquo;m so happy and amazed and proud and thankful for where this band has gone. I&rsquo;ve gotten to see the world -- and I get paid for it! I&rsquo;d have done it for free.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />Chris Fehn agrees. &quot;I think the best part about being in this band has been getting exposure to the rest of the world. You realize that everything in the world is the same -- people feel the same, they have the same desires, hopes, fears. Being worldly is a gift that I don&rsquo;t ever want to give back. It changes your life -- especially when you&rsquo;re from a small town in Iowa.&quot;<br />&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<br />&quot;I always knew we&rsquo;d go far. I just knew it,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;There was no way this band was going to fail. But I never knew we&rsquo;d reach the heights we&rsquo;ve come to. We&rsquo;ve traveled the world so many times all the different countries are like our second homes. To this day, it still blows me away that we took this crazy idea and made it a global sensation.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><strong><em>All Hope Is Gone</em></strong> will be released on Roadrunner Records on August 26th.<br />', 1999, NULL),

A true return to Miller&rsquo;s roots, BINGO! echoes his early years in the Chicago music scene and features carefully chosen and crafted tracks performed in distinctive Steve Miller Band fashion.</p><br><p>&quot;With the continuing evolution of the music industry and the new exciting opportunities that are available I feel this is a perfect time to strike out on my own and develop an imprint where I can have creative control over the future of my music. It is the right time for me to establish new innovative partnerships in the industry and I am looking forward to a long relationship with Roadrunner / Loud &amp Proud&quot; says Miller of the new endeavor.</p><br><p>Early reaction from fans and industry insiders are comparing the album to Miller&rsquo;s 1968 masterpiece <em>SAILOR</em>. BINGO!, will be the first of two albums that were recorded together as a complete body of work, the second of which will be offered next year via the new label partnership.</p><br><p>&quot;After many years of discussion and sharing ideas, the time has finally arrived for Loud &amp Proud and Steve Miller to work together,&quot; commented Loud &amp Proud President Tom Lipsky. &quot;We are proud to be Steve&rsquo;s global label partner and excited to be involved with this landmark project.&quot;</p><br><p>The Steve Miller Band is one of the biggest selling recording, touring and catalog artists of all time, having sold more than 50 million albums worldwide throughout its career. SMB&rsquo;s Greatest Hits 74-78 compilation reached prestigious Diamond Award certification with sales of more than 13 million units sold.</p><br><p>Roadrunner Records President Jonas Nachsin comments &quot;Loud &amp Proud has been gaining serious momentum in the past few months and now boasts a substantial roster with the addition of the incredible Steve Miller Band. Roadrunner is thrilled to be marketing an artist of Steve&rsquo;s legendary status along with our own diverse rock roster.&quot;</p><br><p>BINGO! was co-produced by Andy Johns (Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Van Halen), with artwork designed by the legendary Storm Thorgerson.

(45, 'Stone Sour', '                             <p>When we last saw Stone Sour, the triple-Grammy nominated group was playing sold-out shows around the planet in support of 2006&rsquos critically acclaimed <em>Come What(ever) May</em>, a sonic blockbuster that entered <em>Billboard</em>&rsquos Top 200 Album Chart at No. 4 and went on to sell more than a half-million copies on the strength of three radio hits, including the No. 1 smash single, &quot;Through Glass.&rdquo <em>Billboard</em> hailed the record as &ldquoan intense, taut piece of work,&rdquo <em>Alternative Press </em>called the group &ldquomasters of ass-kicking,&rdquo adding,&rdquo In a better America, Stone Sour would be the face of American rock,&rdquo and <em>Revolver</em> magazine gave the disc four stars and praised the quintet for &ldquodemonstrating a dynamic range equaled by few of their peers.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Four years later, the quintet (vocalist Corey Taylor, guitarists James Root and Josh Rand, bassist Shawn Economaki and drummer Roy Mayorga) have returned with a broadened range, a deepened perspective and the determination to make new album <em>AUDIO SECRECY</em> a multi-layered record free of stylistic limitations. &ldquoIt&rsquos everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do on one album,&rdquo says Taylor. &ldquoIt&rsquo;s heavy, it&rsquo;s melodic, it&rsquos dark, it&rsquos slow, it&rsquos light and it&rsquos beautiful. You&rsquoll hear something different with each listen.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>The group recorded <em>AUDIO SECRECY</em> with <em>Come What(ever) May</em> producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, Deftones) at Nashville&rsquos Blackbird Studios. When they weren&rsquot working on the album, they spent their free time living in a spook-filled crashpad. &quot;That house put us through hell,&rdquo laughs Taylor. &ldquoIt was really old, so everything was broken down and leaking and infested with wasps and spiders. I&rsquo;d get lost because there were so many damn rooms. It was like living in the Haunted Mansion at Disney World. It did keep us in the right mood, though, so maybe we should thank it in the liner notes.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Stone Sour does a lot of things brilliantly&mdashand they do most of them on <em>AUDIO SECRECY</em>, beginning with &ldquoMission Statement,&rdquo an electrifying track that breaks from the gate with white-knuckle intensity. &ldquoIt punches you in the face and drags you by the hair like a caveman,&quot; laughs Taylor. Prior to the album&rsquos release, the band offered &ldquoMission Statement&rdquo as a free download. Fans responded en masse and the track was downloaded more than a 1,000 times an hour within a two day period.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Among <em>AUDIO SECRECY</em>&rsquos endless highlights is &ldquoSay You&rsquoll Haunt Me,&rdquo a heavy-with-melody rock track that best exemplifies the band&rsquos ability to pull in fans from cross-pollinating directions. At the album&rsquos centerpiece is &ldquoHesitate,&rdquo an epic &ldquoNovember Rain&rdquo-ish type track that&rsquos both melodic and melancholic with orchestral strings and a soaring chorus. About the song&rsquos emotion, Taylor says, &ldquoLyric-wise, I&rsquom writing from a more personal space here. Whether talking about a relationship or being a father or finding my soul mate, I&rsquom putting it out there for everyone to hear and feel and see if anybody can relate.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>The album&rsquos title is a play on words for idiosyncrasy. &ldquoI&rsquom a fan of double meanings and metaphorical speak,&rdquo muses Taylor. &ldquoThere are so many levels to what those two words combined could mean. As a title, it perfectly fit the album.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>For guitarist Josh Rand, the track &ldquoThe Pessimist&rdquo holds a special significance. &quot;It&rsquo;s the heaviest song we&rsquo;ve done up to this point. I spent a day and a half studying the Hindu scale for the lead. The guitar solo for that song has a very Eastern sound.&quot;<strong> </strong>The song sees Rand shredding with a precise, powerful solo that&rsquo;s melodic and metallic. All the while, it preserves a unique feel.&nbsp</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&quot;The great thing about Stone Sour is that we&rsquove got five writers in the band and the sound is like different pieces of cloth coming together to form a blanket,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;All you have to do is pull the strings a little tighter to bring those pieces together. Everyone in the band brought in material and we came up with an album that&rsquo;s really alive.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&quot;Threadbare&quot; was written by Mayorga and marks a songwriting debut for the drummer. &quot;The band was really cool and encouraged me to throw some music into the hat,&quot; he says. &quot;It&rsquo;s one of the longer, weirder and darker tracks on the record. I&rsquo;m thrilled everyone embraced it and made it a Stone Sour song. It&rsquo;s very progressive, and it makes for a nice little rollercoaster ride.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>Economaki goes deeper into the track, adding, &quot;It&rsquo;s absolutely epic. It&rsquo;s got clean melodies and it modulates. It takes the listener to a whole different dimension.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>In addition, Stone Sour&rsquo;s trademark dual guitar assault became even tougher with Jim Root and Josh recording simultaneously. There was no need for them to over-digitize parts or go back and water everything down with Pro Tools. Taking an old school approach, both guitarists entered the booth and ripped away. Says Rand, &quot;We&rsquo;re like five guys playing in a garage and it reflects in the music. There&rsquo;s a song for every mood you can possibly go through in a day.&quot;</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&ldquoThis album really represents everything we&rsquove been threatening to do,&rdquo says Taylor. &ldquoIt has so many different vibes and styles&hellipit&rsquos probably the best thing I&rsquove done in a long time.&rdquo</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>That&rsquos a helluva statement considering Taylor&rsquos resume, which includes his &ldquoother gig&rdquo as the lead singer of multi-platinum Grammy winning band Slipknot (Root also pulls double-duty, playing guitar for both groups).</p><br><p>&nbsp</p><br><p>&ldquoI&rsquo;m not trying to change the world, I just want to make music and get some shit off my chest,&rdquo smiles Taylor. &ldquoBut at the end of the day, I hope people dig this record. I hope they grab onto something that they want to sing all day. I hope it gets them excited. I hope it makes them think and I hope it makes them want to start their own bands. I hope it makes them happy and most important of all, I hope they feel that it was worth the wait.&quot;</p>', 2002, NULL),
(46, 'Taking Dawn ', '                             <p>The members of Taking Dawn grew up surrounded by the glitz and glam, the bright lights and big city of constant vice. This LasVegas upbringing helped shaped the band into what it is today: a rock &rsquo;n roll timebomb just waiting to explode on an unsuspecting public with its Roadrunner debut, <em>Time to Burn.</em></p><br><p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve spent our whole lives in Las Vegas and we&rsquo;re the only people from Las Vegas who didn&rsquo;t turn into smack dealers,&quot; says vocalist/guitarist Chris Babbitt, showcasing his signature humor. Babbitt and guitarist Mikey Cross were born at the same hospital and brought into this world by the same doctor. It&rsquo;s as though the stars were aligned and the duo were <em>destined</em> to be in a band.&nbsp Babbitt recalls the band&rsquo;s coming together, saying, &quot;Alan and I met sophomore year in high school when I started playing guitar. I met Mike senior year, after I had been trying to put a band together for many years and it finally happened when we were 21.&quot; Babbitt fell into the frontman role, in what turns out to have been a happy accident. &quot;No one could sing so I was going to have to step it up. Everyone sucked and I happened to suck less,&quot; he says, tongue planted firmly in cheek. Babbitt admits the band started &quot;screwing around&quot; at a local haunt &ndash Roberto&rsquo;s Taco Shop&mdash and everything spiraled from there.</p><br><p>Babbitt and Cross also worked security at the Hard Rock Hotel, which helped them remain surrounded by and immersed in rock &rsquo;n roll. This rough &rsquo;n tumble day job led the duo to appear as the star security guards on True TV&rsquo;s <em>Rehab </em>show.&nbsp Babbitt laughs about his role on the reality show, saying, &quot;I save a lot of lives, kick a lot of ass!&quot;</p><br><p>One other way Taking Dawn kicks a lot of ass is in their band. &quot;All the glitz and being immersed by constant vice has steered us in the other direction,&quot; Babbitt admits. &quot;We don&rsquo;t drink a lot, smoke or do drugs. We&rsquo;re just about the music and the girls that come with it!&quot; While most of the members were just born when Guns N&rsquo; Roses was tearing up the Sunset Strip in L.A., Taking Dawn got up to speed and on the quick, with their steadfast rock &rsquo;n roll dedication and education. Chris&rsquo; dad was a rocker and a hippie, and his son was predisposed to a life of loving Black Sabbath and Deep Purple. &quot;He played Sabbath while he vacuumed around my crib. When I got picked up from kindergarten, he&rsquo;d ask me what track was playing,&quot; he remembers. Babbitt also learned to love the rock early and that&rsquo;s something he&rsquo;s taken with him into his &rsquo;20s and within his local scene.&nbsp He says, &quot;Las Vegas is represented by The Killers and Panic At The Disco. There is no real rock &rsquo;face&rsquo; here anymore. Slaughter was the last rock band, so I feel like we have a lot to carry on that end, as a rock band, to bring attention to the scene.&quot;</p><br><p>While Taking Dawn are by no means a throwback to 80s glam metal, the band is certainly inspired by the era gone by and have chosen to take the foundation of that sound and scene and update it in a thoroughly modern way: by shredding, soloing and creating melody in their music.&nbsp &quot;I don&rsquot get people who don&rsquo;t like Bon Jovi and Skid Row and other classic bands,&quot; he says.&nbsp &quot;We want to bring it to the kids, for them to understand it in a modern context. We don&rsquo;t want to imitate. We want to do our own thing. We want the balls and the attitude.&quot;<br /> <br /> <em>Time To Burn </em>has the desired cojones and a whole lotta attitude.&nbsp The title track was the one that attracted the attention of Roadrunner, due to the fact that it&rsquo;s fast, oozes energy and makes a big statement. &quot;It goes, &rsquo;Homicidal, kill your idols / Your heroes are whores and your only God is you.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a big statement about what we want to say. We don&rsquo;t want to look like &quot;some&quot; part or image and we&rsquo;re saying you don&rsquo;t have to do drugs and be complete fuck up to still rock harder than the rest of them.&quot; Amen to that!&nbsp The band is particularly proud of the song, saying,&nbsp &quot;We can write an aggressive, catchy song that shreds.&quot; The song even has a part where the band sings, &rsquo;Halle-Fucking-lujah.&rsquo;&nbsp Of that moment, Babbitt offers further explanation, saying, &quot;It builds differently, instead of being the same formulaic, pseudo-anti-establishment and anti-organized religion song. It has religious innuendo. You know, it&rsquo;s the one word Ozzy never said! I needed one word he didn&rsquo;t already use. It&rsquo;s liberating and fun as fuck to sing. We almost didn&rsquo;t keep that part but it&rsquo;s the hook of the song.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;Take Me Away&quot; is a playful romp about a lady of the night, so to speak, and sonically, it lives at the other end of the spectrum of the band&rsquo;s style: it has a metallic edge dosed with the catchy pop the band cops to liking. &quot;We like songs that are classics and that have hooks. We want to connect with people,&quot; Babbitt says.&nbsp &quot;Everyone agrees on the same top 50 songs that make up the musical canon. We want to slide into that 50. This song is rock &rsquo;n roll with the baddest guitars around and it&rsquo;s catchier than herpes.&quot; While it&rsquo;s a bold statement for the band to make, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with confidence and bravado when there is talent and skill to back it up.</p><br><p>The band also shows off its non-standard side by covering Fleetwood Mac&rsquo;s &quot;The Chain.&quot; They originally planned to do their own rendition of WASP&rsquo;s &quot;Fuck Like a Beast,&quot; but decided to switch gears. Babbitt says, &quot;We wanted to do something more ambitious, even though that song summed up the band and we want to give that song limelight. Then we started thinking of alternatives and we didn&rsquo;t want to be pigeonholed by the 80s scene even though we love bands from that era. Mike was rolling through songs and that is our favorite Fleetwood Mac song. We have the opportunity to do what Metallica did for &rsquo;Turn the Page&rsquo; and make it our own while retaining the original audience.&quot;</p><br><p>The band demoed with Jason Suecof (Trivium, All That Remains) and eventually recorded with Elvis Baskette (Chevelle, Incubus). In the end, Babbitt wants to write songs that sound like Randy Rhoads meets Marty Friedman, merging the classic rock and modern metal sounds into their own unique blend.&nbsp He admits, &quot;We&rsquo;re not trying to write other people&rsquo;s songs. We&rsquo;re trying to write songs that kick your fucking ass but have a vintage feel.&quot; He also eschews genre classification, saying, &quot;Our music is about attitude and being open to rocking out to a song. That goes far for us. The genre barrier bullshit is not for us. You can do both. You don&rsquo;t have to be a savior or a martyr. That kills music.&quot;</p><br><p>Genres, compartmentalization and safe rock &rsquo;n roll be damned.</p>', 2009, NULL),
(47, 'Theory of a Deadman', '                             <strong>Theory of a Deadman</strong> had a simple but daunting goal for its third album:  to make the greatest record possible. <br /> <br />&quot;I always try to remind the guys and myself that there are 20 bands lined up behind us just waiting for a chance to take our place,&quot; says frontman Tyler Connolly.  &quot;So that means we had to go in there and make a great record.&quot; With <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em>, the Vancouver trio has hit its mark.<br /> <br />The balanced 13-track effort is the polished and passionate testament to seven years of hard work, heavy touring and diligent attention to its craft. From the swirling grind of &quot;By the Way&quot; to the nasty snarl of &quot;Crutch&quot; to the soaring melodicism of &quot;Not Meant to Be&quot; and &quot;Wait For Me,&quot; <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> is a broad-reaching endeavor that puts Connolly, guitarist Dave Brenner and bassist Dean Back high in the rock pantheon, achieving creative growth without sacrificing the hard-hitting power that got them here in the first place.<br /> <br />&quot;We really dug hard on this one,&quot; Connolly notes. &quot;The longer you&rsquo;re in a band, the more you write songs, the better you get. We&rsquo;ve had such a great opportunity to figure out what to do better, how to write a better song and keep building and building. That&rsquo;s exciting for us.&quot;<br /> <br /><em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> began taking shape in February of 2007, as Theory was winding down from touring to support its second album, 2005&rsquo;s Gasoline, a slump-defying sophomore outing that launched the hits &quot;No Surprise,&quot; &quot;Say Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Santa Monica&quot; and &quot;Hello Lonely (Walk Away From This).&quot; The group returned to Grammy-nominated producer Howard Benson, who in turn issued marching orders that set the tone for the project. <br /> <br />&quot;Before we even went into the studio, Howard wanted to gear this record up to sound huge,&quot; Connolly recalls about Benson&rsquo;s &quot;all killer, no filler&quot; approach to the record. &quot;He said, &lsquoYou have to go into a record with great songs. You can&rsquo;t make them while you&rsquo;re there. You can&rsquo;t just go in with one or two great songs. You&rsquo;ve got to have 10.&rsquo; So we just kept sending him songs until we had the 10 to 12 great ones, and then he said, &rsquo;OK, let&rsquo;s go.&rsquo;&quot;<br /> <br />Theory actually brought about 17 songs to Los Angeles&rsquo; Bay 7 studios in August of 2007. Amidst low-key hijinks -- Brenner and Back grew mustaches, Connolly sported a fake one in the name of band unity -- the group and studio drummer Robin Diaz recorded 15 before choosing the 12 that ultimately comprise Scars &amp Souvenirs, which proved an apt title for the range of emotions Connolly sings about on the album.<br /> <br />&quot;It&rsquo;s the <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> of your life,&quot; he explains. &quot;The songwriting on the record is really about someone&rsquo;s past or and present, their relationships and how they shape everything. It&rsquo;s more metaphorical than physical scars and trophies.&quot;<br /> <br />And while Connolly has certainly done his turn as a rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll king of pain on Gasoline and 2002&rsquo;s attention-catching debut Theory Of A Deadman, he went into <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> determined to show he could be more than the &quot;callous bastard&quot; Rolling Stone magazine called him in an early profile.<br><p>Here, Connolly explores broad new lyrical terrain, indicative of his growth as a person and as songwriter. &quot;For awhile there, every song was, &rsquo;Get the f*&ampk out! I don&rsquo;t need women! Screw them!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s kinda how I felt at that point,&quot; Connolly says with a self-effacing laugh. &quot;But I&rsquo;ve grown as a songwriter, and as a person. I wanted to write some different, nicer songs for a change.&quot;<br /> <br />He didn&rsquo;t have to look hard for inspiration. He wrote &quot;Wait For Me,&quot; with its acoustic guitar underpinning and rich chorus, for his wife, paying tribute to her fortitude in being home alone while he&rsquo;s on the road. The piano-laden &quot;All or Nothing,&quot; meanwhile, chronicles their relationship, which began as a good friendship before blossoming into romance. &quot;It was kind of sick of me writing all these woman-hater songs before,&quot; acknowledges Connolly, whose mother left his family when he was in high school, providing rich source material for his earlier work. &quot;People thought I was writing about my wife.&quot; While Connolly&rsquo;s lyrics have taken on a kinder, gentler pallor on <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em>, the band continues to keep the knobs cranked to 11. <br /> <br />Connolly also went into <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> trying to write some songs that were &quot;just for fun,&quot; and succeeded with tracks such as &quot;End of Summer,&quot; an anthem about the bittersweetness of endings, whether that of a season or a relationship.<br /> <br />But even though the album mines a deeper emotional trough, it charges with the same potent force of its predecessors. When fans eagerly crank up the likes of &quot;So Happy,&quot; &quot;Got it Made&quot; and  &quot;Bad Girlfriend,&quot; they&rsquo;ll end up with a set of blown out speakers, thanks to the firepower that crackles in these rockers, while &quot;Sacrifice&quot; bristles with the kind of primal, super-charged defiance that has long defined the best hard rock. <br /> <br />&quot;A lot of bands, they grow older and they get grayer and they just can&rsquo;t do the rock songs anymore,&quot; Connolly says. &quot;I don&rsquo;t see that happening to us. Fans are gonna hear our record and hear some softer stuff, but we&rsquo;re a rock band. I think it sounds bigger than the other two (albums) we&rsquo;ve done.&quot;<br /> <br />Which is, not surprisingly, why Connolly, Brenner and Back are chomping at the bit to take <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em> out on the road. &quot;We really want to take the band farther this time,&quot; Connolly says. &quot;We want to get out there to places we have not been before - where a lot of our fans are --Asia, Australia, as well as reaching our fans in North America and Europe. We&rsquo;re just a hard-working band, man. We want to be out there for a couple of years and play these songs to everybody we possibly can.&quot;</p><br><p>With an album like <em><strong>Scars &amp Souvenirs</strong></em>, the fans will be lining up to listen.</p>', 2002, NULL),

(49, 'Trivium', '                             As the years fly by at breath-stealing speed, the aim of every self-respecting metal band must surely be to stake a claim for immortality to carve their name with pride into metal&rsquo;s metaphorical Mount Rushmore. In the modern era, as countless new (and not so new) bands jostle for position at the front of the grid, it becomes ever harder to pick the wheat from the chaff, the weak from the strong. But amid such a swarm of mediocrity, the greatest bands always rise effortlessly to the top, building in confidence and momentum with each incremental step forward, learning from their mistakes, gaining nourishment and focus from their triumphs and growing, with gathering speed, into something that truly matters. It&rsquo;s 2008 and Trivium fit that description perfectly. One listen to their jaw-dropping new album, the mighty Shogun, will be all the convincing you need that their time has arrived.<br><p>&quot;We wrote this album exactly the way we all wanted to,&quot; says frontman Matt Heafy. &quot;We really did our own thing this time. When people check it out, they&rsquo;ll realize that we&rsquo;re not an exclusive band. We&rsquo;re not doing this for one specific kind of person. If you want to come to a show and rock out, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for. We&rsquo;re just four normal guys who just happen to be able to play metal for lots of cool people around the world.&quot;</p><br><p>The <strong>Trivium</strong> story began in earnest with the release of their <strong>Roadrunner </strong>debut, 2005&rsquo;s Ascendancy album the perfect way to introduce the band - Heafy, guitarist Corey Beaulieu, bassist Paolo Gregoletto and drummer Travis Smith - to a newly revitalized global metal scene.  The album exhibited great depth and musicality, and immediately set the band apart from the pack, turning them into one of the most widely hailed bands the genre had produced in years.</p><br><p>In the US,  Europe, Japan and Australia - and particularly in the UK, where Trivium shot from nowhere to conquering the annual Download Festival at Castle Donington and becoming a major headlining act - Heafy and co. were making major waves, touring relentlessly around the globe and building up a huge international fan base.</p><br><p>Released in the autumn of 2006 - a mere 18 months after its predecessor - <strong>Trivium</strong>&rsquo;s second <strong>Roadrunner</strong> release <strong><em>The Crusade</em></strong> was a massive milestone a bold, and adventurous move that both consolidated their reputation as metal&rsquo;s fastest rising young band and proved that unlike their peers, <strong>Trivium</strong> were more than happy to take a few risks in order to further nurture their art.</p><br><p>Buoyed by critical acclaim, a hugely positive response from the fans and a seemingly never-ending stream of high profile tours, including a successful cross-Europe joint as special guests to Iron Maiden and a triumphant stint on the Ozzfest tour in the US, <strong>Trivium</strong> quickly threw themselves into the writing process for Shogun, spending many on-the-road hours honing and refining their newest material in anticipation of hitting the studio, this time with renowned producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters/Stone Sour/Death Angel).</p><br><p>&quot;We were writing on tour for a year straight,&quot; says Heafy. &quot;When we were on the Black Crusade tour in Australia, I showed the <strong>Machine Head</strong> guys the songs. I respect Robb Flynn such an incredible amount as a musician and a person and I wanted to know what he thought. He called me up and gave me a really good talk about demoing and revisiting songs and all that, so we went back to the rehearsal studio and completely re-wrote everything. Then we sent the stuff to Nick, and then between us we picked the 13 best songs. We went to Franklin, Tennessee, where we lived for eight weeks, and recorded at Sound Kitchen Studios. It&rsquo;s a legendary country music studio where Willie Nelson recorded. Everyone was amazing and so nice, so it was a great working environment for us.&quot;</p><br><p>There is a moment for every great band when everything comes together and a definitive musical identity emerges. For <strong>Trivium</strong>, this is it. The collaboration with Raskulinecz has taken <strong>Trivium</strong> to new compositional and technical levels, while the album&rsquo;s brutal, bone-shattering production means that they&rsquo;ve never sounded heavier or more powerful. With lashings of vicious riffs that celebrate the band&rsquo;s love of death, black and thrash metal, alongside the most incisive and memorable melodies the quartet have ever written, Shogun is a monstrous achievement that promises to have the cynics and naysayers choking on their toast.</p><br><p>&quot;It was all very natural,&quot; explains Heafy. &quot;We didn&rsquo;t care what was going to come out, and that&rsquo;s why it sounds this way. We all still love extremely heavy music with the brutality and no melody, but we also love stuff that&rsquo;s incredibly melodic and simple and memorable, so that explains the two extremes. We like to have everything. Vocally we tried everything from the lowest note I can sing to the highest note, from the lowest growl to the highest scream, and everything in between. We wanted to try it all. That was the whole concept behind the record. No limits!&quot;</p><br><p>Although <em><strong>Shogun</strong></em> is not a concept album in the traditional sense, the influence of Heafy&rsquo;s own Japanese background - its warrior culture, its strong sense of pride - is present through every last second of these powerful, emotive metal anthems. Both opener &quot;Kirisute Gomen&quot; and the album&rsquo;s mighty 12-minute title track are perfect examples of this, as Heafy explains. &quot; &lsquoKirisute Gomen&quot; was an ancient Samurai code that basically meant that if you angered a Samurai or pissed them off, they&rsquo;d have to chop your head off,&quot; states Heafy. &quot;It was like the martial law of the Samurai. The title of the album came to me when we were on our second tour of Japan, and I was on a bus tour and they were talking about how the <em><strong>Shogun</strong></em> were the highest ranking military generals. It was the coolest name I&rsquo;d ever heard before, so I knew I&rsquo;d use it for something some day. When we started writing this music and I heard how epic it all was, I said to the guys &lsquoI&rsquo;ve had this title in my head for ages, how do you think it&rsquo;d work as the title of the album?&rsquo; and they loved it too. The definition of the word just commands strength and it feels powerful, so it was perfect.&quot;</p><br><p>Alongside tales of ancient Japan, the album also delves into the brain-boggling world of ancient Greek mythology, with songs like &quot;Torn Between Scylla And Charybdis&quot; and &quot;Of Prometheus And The Crucifix&quot; revelling in the imagery and drama of symbolic sagas first told many thousands of years ago.</p><br><p>&quot;When you look at something like religion, people seem to take those stories as true events that really happened,&quot; states Heafy. &quot;With mythology, everyone knew these were stories created, and used them as ways to help live their lives better or to help them to cope with things. So I&rsquo;ve used those myths as a tool to help further develop the lyrics.&quot;</p><br><p><strong>Trivium</strong> have been threatening to make that final leap from established contenders to full-on metal heroes for the last few years, and with <em><strong>Shogun</strong></em>, their fourth and manifestly best album to date, they have clearly mastered the metal arts and are ready to step into the arena with the genre&rsquo;s greats. From the bludgeoning bombast of &quot;Kirisute Gomen&quot; through to the hook-laden savagery of &quot;Down From The Sky&quot; and &quot;Into The Mouth Of Hell We March&quot;, and on to the towering steel-plated genius of &quot;Shogun&quot; itself, this is truly <strong>Trivium</strong>&rsquo;s defining album and the first stone-cold classic of their career. With over 800 live shows under their belt to date, Florida&rsquo;s finest are ready to hit the road again and this time they have both the songs and the self-belief to take on all-comers.</p><br><p>&quot;This first shows we do for this album are gonna be just us, our instruments and the music,&quot; says Heafy with obvious pride. &quot;There&rsquo;s not going to be any fancy shit going on. It&rsquo;s just gonna be raw, brutal and exactly what this album is. It&rsquo;s about the music, and that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re about. We hope everyone comes out to see us and we hope you all dig the record.

(50, 'Within Temptation', '                               <p>With the rise of gothic metal, dozens of bands have combined crunchy power chord volleys with ethereal vocals and orchestral arrangements, but none have done so as convincingly or with such a keen grasp for symphonic arrangements as Holland&#39s <strong>Within Temptation</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>Formed by chanteuse <strong>Sharon den Adel</strong> and guitarist <strong>Robert Westerholt</strong> in 1996, Within Temptation have become superstars across Europe over the course of three studio albums. Now, with a new deal with Roadrunner Records and their epic new album, <strong><em>The Heart of Everything</em></strong>, the band seems destined bring its majestic, emotion-swept music to new heights.</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotWe pushed ourselves to make these songs the best that we could,&quot says Westerholt of the new record. &quotWe wanted to have a more organic feeling and more energy than ever. I think our last one, [2004&#39s <em>The Silent Force</em>], went a bit too far in one direction at times the orchestra pushed away the drums and guitars. This time we tried to get the guitars more prominent and have more riffs. It still has a big feeling and there&#39s still plenty of classical parts, but I think we did it without losing the power of the band.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p><em>The Heart of Everything</em>, Within Temptation has never sounded more powerful or alive. The first single &quotWhat Have You Done,&quot featuring <strong>Keith Caputo</strong> of Life of Agony, which see-saws between caustic guitar crunch and gothy, gauzy textures, is the perfect marriage of melodic rock and metal. The equally powerful track &quotThe Howling&quot showcases Den Adel&#39s trademark haunting vocals and soaring melodies, while the glacial &quotFrozen,&quot features heartrending vocals and staccato string bursts and &quotThe Cross&quot which starts like an intro to a film score, segues into a winding, dramatic number that&#39s equal parts Richard Wagner, The Gathering and Kate Bush.</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotOur biggest goal besides writing the best songs we can was to give this record more energy than the last one,&quot says singer Sharon den Adel. &quotI used my voice in a different way on every song. Sometimes it&#39s high and melodic, almost classical, and in some songs it&#39s lower with power.&quot </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotWe made very careful choices when we were writing these songs,&quot adds Westerholt. &quotWe didn&#39t use orchestra everywhere and we also cut down a bit in the layering of the arrangements so they were more efficient and had less choruses so they could work better together with the band.&quot </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>While Within Temptation was more selective about their compositions and less effusive with their classical elements, they experimented as much as ever, adding mandolin to &quotThe Cross,&quot cello to four tracks and working with the Prague Orchestra instead of individual players or synthetic strings. </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotWe like to try different things and when we&#39re writing a song, we never know where that inspiration comes from,&quot adds Den Adel. &quotIt&#39s always very spontaneous and that&#39s what makes the music unique.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>The band chose the album title <em>The Heart of Everything</em> because the songs address feelings and ideas that exist under the surface and can&#39t be excavated without introspection. &quotSo often, we live our lives without thinking,&quot Westerholt explains. &quotWe just do things because we&#39re born in a certain environment and people are expecting certain things from you. Sometimes its important to look within yourself and discover what really makes you happy and what&#39s important to you.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>In their search for self-discovery, Within Temptation address a variety of subjects, including the futility of war (&quotOur Solemn Hour&quot), the strength of unconditional love (&quotForgiven&quot) and personal hardships faced by certain bandmembers (&quotThe Cross&quot). Books inspired some tracks, like &quotHand of Sorrow.&quot Others were based on films. </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotWe wrote &lsquoThe Heart of Everything&#39 after watching &lsquoBraveheart,&#39 says Westerholt. &quotAnd &lsquoThe Truth Beneath the Rose&#39 is based on &lsquoThe Da Vinci Code&#39 and is about the idea that belief is sometimes used to justify sins. On the other hand, it may be more important with belief that it&#39s your own belief and you can stand behind it instead of following the belief other people may want to put upon you.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>Within Temptation started writing the new songs at the end of 2005 and fine-tuned the material until late 2006. &quotWe take our time to make our record,&quot explains Den Adel. &quotWe are not easily satisfied with ourselves, and the recording process is very time consuming because we record many instruments and sounds on our record beside the usual band stuff.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotActually, this was our fastest follow-up,&quot adds Westerholt. &quotSo I think this was our easiest album to do. However, no album is ever really easy because there are big ups and downs in the writing and recording process. But in comparison to the other ones, this one felt the best.&quot</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>With good reason. <em>The Heart of Everything</em> recaptures everything Within Temptation has thrived upon while taking their music to newer, more thrilling places. And in the process, through all the melancholy atmospheres, cinematic riffs and angelic vocals, the band delivers its most pragmatic and proactive message to date. </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>  <p>&quotIf you want to make something out of your life, it&#39s in your own hands,&quot Westerholt says. &quotLife can sometimes be pretty rough and not very easy, but still you have a lot of power within yourself and there&#39s always the possibility to bend things your own way.&quot</p>    ', 2007, NULL),

(52, '3 Inches of Blood', '                             <p>There&#39s a reason fans have come to their shows wearing Viking helmets and brandishing both real and plastic swords. Born out of a love for pure metal, weaned on a diet of fantasy and mythology, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> have been slaying the infidel and defending the faith for nearly eight years. </p>      <p>In that time, they&#39ve released two albums and splattered the ground with crimson streaks while on tour with Satyricon, Black Dahlia Murder, Motorhead and Cradle of Filth. These are mighty accomplishments for dedicated warriors from Vancouver, British Columbia, a region that&#39s not exactly the Camelot of heavy metal. And with their new album, <strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong>, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> have surpassed even their own manly exploits, crafting a baker&#39s dozen of anthems and stormers that crash, rip and roar like a Medieval skirmish.<br /><br /> &quotWith this album, the blacksmith is heating up the blades and we are preparing for battle,&quot says vocalist Jamie Hooper. &quotWe are forging the steel that we&#39ll use to annihilate the heavy metal posers, and in every town we play, the streets will run red with their blood.&quot</p>    <p>Throughout <strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong>, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> demonstrate that the best way to stay ahead of the heavy metal curve is to write music that comes from the heart and sounds nothing like the horde of bands tapping into the latest trends. To that end, they draw fuel from their favorite artists, including Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Manowar and Enslaved and compile it all into their own lethal potion. Once more, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> demonstrate great skill for riding galloping steeds into fiery realms of crunching riffs and banging heads, but <strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong> is darker and more aggressive than 2004&#39s critically acclaimed <strong><em>Advance and Vanquish</em></strong>. &quotDemon&#39s Blade&quot starts with a crushing, technical thrash passage and peaks with twin guitar harmonies over throat-shredding vocals and &quotInfinite Legions&quot features hailstorm blast beats and orchestral swells between martial riffs.</p>    <p>&quotThis album is heavily influenced by low quality beer, bong rips and listening to black metal in the dark,&quot Hooper says. &quotIt doesn&#39t sound blatantly black metal, it still sounds like us. But it&#39s a faster, more intense version of us.&quot</p>    <p><strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong> marks the recording debut of four out of six of the bandmembers. Hooper, who co-formed the group, and co-vocalist Cam Pipes are the only soldiers to return from the last battle, and they&#39re joined by guitarists Shane Clark, Justin Hagberg, bassist Nick Cates and drummer Alexei Rodriguez. But even though the lineup is different, the aesthetic remains the same, and the skill level actually eclipses that of the last record. </p>    <p>&quotSometimes when bands change members it seems like big step backwards, but this was a major step forwards for us,&quot Hooper says. &quotEveryone new who came in was at their best, which forced everybody else to pick up their game a little bit and we came up with things we just couldn&#39t have done before.&quot</p>    <p>Also adding to the skull-splintering vibe was Slipknot drummer <strong>Joey Jordison</strong>, who produced the record. Jordison became a fan of <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> in 2004 when he filled in for Satyricon on tour and <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> opened. &quotWhen he found out we were doing another record, he offered his services, and we were like, &lsquoDude, of course!&quot Hooper says. &quotHe added a fresh perspective to the songs and helped us work on some parts and arrangements. Also, he&#39s a beer drinking encyclopedia of cult black metal, so we sat around drinking Pabst Blue Ribbons talking about necro black metal the whole time, which was awesome.&quot</p>    <p><strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> started writing <em><strong>Fire Up the Blades</strong> </em>in late 2006 and composed many of the songs in a house they rented in Tacoma, Washington early this year. They entered the studio with Jordison in October and recorded at three locations in Vancouver -- The Armory, Mushroom Studios and Hipposonic -- before finishing up at London Bridge Studios in Seattle. </p>    <p>&quotOur engineer saw a ghost, but other than that, everything went smoothly,&quot Hooper says. &quotNo one was tearing their hair out or yelling at each other. We were just drinking, having a good time and churning out the metal.&quot<br /> </p>    <p>Hooper co-formed <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> in Victoria, British Columbia in 2000. In addition to a batch of musicians who are long gone, he recruited singer Cam Pipes, whose high pitched shrieks both contrast with and compliment Hooper&#39s vicious growls. In 2001 the group released its debut, <strong><em>Battlecry Under a Winter Sun</em></strong>, which was released by a label owned by a local record store. When the shop closed, <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> self-financed additional pressings of the album, which laid the foundation for the band&#39s epic style of music with songs like &quotDestroy the Orcs,&quot &quotSkeletal Onslaught&quot and &quotHeadwaters of the River of Blood.&quot<br /><br /> &quotWhen we started, a lot of us came out of this DIY scene where most of the bands had some sort of message,&quot Hooper says. &quotI support that, but we wanted to be band that was just about good times, and would just cut loose. The music that we love and puts smiles on our faces is classic metal. And, we&#39re all fans of shitty movies and fantasy novels, so we decided to use that stuff as well in our music.&quot</p>    <p>Compelled by the band&#39s dedication and determination, Roadrunner Records signed <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> and in 2004 released <strong><em>Advance and Vanquish</em></strong>, an album that brought to mind the best of bands like Running Wild, Grave Digger, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Diamond Head. As triumphant as it was, its creation was a long and bloody process. &quotWe went through about 12 records worth of bullshit making that,&quot says Hooper. &quotOn the first day of recording, our drummer and bass player quit. So we had to replace them with guys who basically learned the songs as we were recording them. And, after we recorded, our two guitar players quit. But then our new guitarists [Hagberg and Clark] joined and we were like, &lsquoAlright, it&#39s <em>go</em> time.&#39&quot</p>    <p>Which brings us back to <strong><em>Fire Up the Blades</em></strong>, an album that combines fist-tight musicianship, rib-sticking riffs and more monsters and mayhem than a game of <em>Dungeons &amp Dragons</em>. No longer, do <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> sing about pirates and cyborgs, now they&#39re more rooted to a dark, mystical era when great beasts roamed the land, and a man was defined by the strength of his armor and the power of his sword. </p>    <p>&quotThe general theme of the whole thing is that we are all united in battle,&quot Hooper says. &quotBut a lot of the songs are also about the imagined Christian demons coming forth from their imaginations and reaping the whirlwind, so to speak. It&#39s more of a post-apocalyptic doom scenario. &lsquo&#39Mad Max&#39 barren wasteland, everybody&#39s fucked kind of stuff.&quot</p>    <p>While <strong>3 Inches of Blood</strong> are eager to see how fans react to their new album, and are even looking forward to the return of the kids with swords and shields, they&#39re also curious about what new kinds of lunatics will pop up at their shows. &quotThe music&#39s more extreme now, but I don&#39t know how much more extreme some of these fans can get,&quot Hooper says. &quotIn Cincinnati, we had a fellow come onstage with a pig&#39s head on a stick. He fell down and dropped the head and we had to soccer ball kick it off the stage. Then, in Fargo, North Dakota, a guy came on holding a severed deer&#39s head over his head. The tongue was sticking out and blood was dripping all over his face. How much more metal can you get than that?&quot </p>    Take a running dive into <strong><em>The Blades</em></strong>, and find out.', 2004, NULL),
(53, '36 Crazyfists', '                             Despite the state of today&#39s tumultuous world, the Alaska-bred, melodic metal band <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong> are inspired to look beyond the negative and aggressively emphasize the positive. They are able to distance themselves from the pack by never resorting to stereotypical metal rage while maintaining their heavy roots.  Whether front man Brock Lindow addresses road fatigue, self-worth or accountability, the music is fueled by a contagious enthusiasm and optimism in the face of frustration.   The band&#39s third album <em>Rest Inside The Flames</em> is a record of this and comes across as an energized batch of modern anthems built upon a pyre of swarming emotions, stomping, surging rhythms and vocals that seesaw between scathing rage and melodic regret. And the band&#39s universal, contemporary sounds are earning them an army of fans across the world, especially in Europe, where they have been embraced by thousands of people, playing main stages at some of the biggest rock festivals on the continent.  It&#39s easy to see why. <em>Rest Inside The Flames</em> offers a fresh take on aggressive music that simultaneously revels in strength and vulnerability, while carving a path of self-reliance and personal expression as wide as an ocean basin.   &quotI&#39ll Go Until My Heart Stops&quot begins with a barked verse that builds into a climactic roar before leveling off in a contagious chorus. &quotElysium,&quot is a colossal slab of brutality filled with dense, chugging breakdowns, yet buoyed by unexpected blasts of melody. And &quotThe Great Descent&quot opens with a plangent guitar arpeggio and pain-stricken vocals before building into a hailstorm of slamming beats and angular riffs. In addition to being more lyrically revealing the album is also more musically developed and heavier than their previous work. &quotThere&#39s a lot more double-bass than before and a lot more mosh parts,&quot Lindow says. &quotWe&#39ve always been pretty heavy live, but it hasn&#39t really translated on record before. So, with this one, there was more of a focus to make sure the songs would rock as hard on the record as they will in concert.&quot    A perfect juxtaposition to the thematic heaviness of some tracks, &quotAurora&quot is about the magnificence of the Northern Lights and how they reflect the magic of love and life.  &quotOn Any Given Night&quot addresses the quest to stay upbeat when thousands of miles away from friends and family and &quotMidnight Swim&quot is about having the strength to take advantage of second chances. &quotWe live in a country where you can chase your dreams and have more than one chance to make them happen,&quot Lindow says. &quotThe song is about the people who chase dreams and the journey that goes along with that.&quot   <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong> started working on <em>Rest Inside The Flames</em> in February 2005, less than two months after they stopped touring behind <em>A Snow Capped Romance</em>. By September they had most of the songs written and in October they entered the studio with producer Sal Villaneuva, who has worked on albums by bands like Thursday and Taking Back Sunday. Lindow says. &quotHe is very melodically in tune, but he also knows how to get killer metal tones, so it was awesome working with him.&quot  While the sessions were long and sometimes grueling, the band generally enjoyed the recording process -- especially when friends came over to help them out. Former touring partner and Killswitch Engage singer Howard Jones fulfilled an old promise to collaborate with the band by adding guest vocals to &quotElysium&quot and Only Living Witness singer Jonah Jenkins pitched in on &quotWe Cannot Deny.&quot  &quotOnly Living Witness was one of our favorite bands growing up, so we really wanted him to be on the record,&quot Lindow says. &quotOver the years, I made friends with him online, which is a little weird. But he lives in Boston so he came down to New Jersey when we were recording, and that was awesome.&quot  Formed in Anchorage, Alaska in 1994, <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong> named themselves after a Jackie Chan film, and immediately created a buzz coming out of the frigid scene. When their original bassist died in a car accident in 1996, they moved to Portland, Oregon and persevered. They soon made friends with propulsive thrash band Skinlab, who passed their demo to the A&ampR department at Roadrunner Records. They were signed in 2000 and immediately entered the studio to work on their debut album <em>Bitterness The Star</em> which came out in 2002 established the band as a powerful new force.     Lindow grew up quite a bit since then and his new lease on life shone through <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong>&#39 2004 album <em>A Snow Capped Romance</em>, which showcased positive lyrics with accompanying heartrending melodies that shared elements in common with emotionally expulsive performers like Thursday and Thrice. The band supported the disc on tours with Killswitch Engage and Poison the Well and remained on the road until December 2004. A month later, the band started writing songs for <em>Rest Inside The Flames</em>. From the ominous arpeggios and ecstatic, distorted ring of &quotFelt Through a Phone Line&quot to the skewed chug and harmonized chorus of &quotOn Any Given Night&quot to the tumbling beats and barbed licks of  &quotMidnight Swim,&quot <strong>36 Crazyfists</strong> gives a new twist to familiar themes and leaves listeners energized with fists clenched.  &quotWe have fun making music and I think that comes across,&quot concludes Lindow. &quotHopefully, at the same time, we can connect with people and help them deal with whatever&#39s going on in their lives so they can have a good time as well. That&#39s what it&#39s about for me, trying to connect with people and hopefully everybody&#39s enjoying themselves and having a good time.&quot', 2002, NULL),
(54, 'Amanda Palmer', '                             The idea was a simple one:  songs for the piano and voice, recorded in one week in a bedroom, just to get them down on tape.  But like all things surrounding <strong>The Dresden Dolls&rsquo; Amanda Palmer</strong> &ndash a one-woman machine who is a rock musician, artist, writer, yoga enthusiast, political activist and more &ndash simplicity is not an easy thing to come by.  Her small idea snowballed into something grand, exciting and nothing short of brilliant in the form of her debut solo album, <strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong>.<br /><br />Born and raised in the Boston, &quot;simple&quot; has never been a way to describe <strong>Amanda Palmer&rsquo;s</strong> undeniable talent and passion for creating art.  With years of theater and performance art studies under her belt, Palmer has always sought to merge the worlds of rock music, theater and performance art...even when it&rsquo;s meant biting off more than she can conceivably chew (Palmer, never one to shy from a challenge, always finds a way to get it done, and to do it well).  Post-college, she was notorious around Boston as a &quot;living statue&quot; street performer, art-party impresario and DIY theater director.   And, occasionally, a piano-bashing singer-songwriter, setting up shop in small galleries and friends&rsquo; parties and sharing what would eventually become the first batch of songs for The Dresden Dolls.  Upon meeting drummer Brian Viglione at a party in 2000, The Dresden Dolls were born, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Until history took a bit of a turn.  With multiple critically-acclaimed records under her belt, Palmer could have easily continued on that trajectory &ndash but as the band hit their consecutive fifth year of touring, Palmer decided to take a breather and create her first solo album - a stripped-down piano-and-voice affair to be recorded at home.  &quot;I was all set to just bang out the tunes in my bedroom with the help of a local engineer and was locking the dates when Ben Folds showed up on the scene. He emailed the band&rsquo;s website while he was on tour in Japan, gushing about how much he loved our records. I was totally ecstatic and jumped up and down for a while and then dug out my old Ben Folds CDs and wrote him back immediately,&quot; explains Palmer.  &quot;We struck up a fast friendship, and fate would have it that we were both in Australia a few weeks later, so we met up and had a good old-fashioned geeky-piano-songwriter-bonding session.  He told me that if I ever needed to use his chock-full-o-pianos studio in Nashville, he&rsquo;d be happy to loan it. I told him that, as a matter of fact, I was plotting a solo album and would love to make use of it. He stopped and thought for a second, asked me if he could produce the record and I said yes without blinking an eye...I just had a good feeling about it and knew I could trust him. And I wound up being blown away by what Ben brought to the table, he went beyond my expectations in spades.&quot;<br />The resulting sessions culminated in Palmer&rsquo;s solo record, Who Killed Amanda Palmer.  Spanning almost ten years&rsquo; worth of songwriting, Palmer had nearly thirty compositions to sort through with Folds when she finally went down to Nashville to begin working on them.  &quot;My recent songs, like &rsquo;Point of It All&rsquo; and &rsquo;Guitar Hero&rsquo; all seemed like no-brainers because they represent a newer and mature kind of songwriting for me, but there were some older ones that Ben was curious about, like &rsquo;Runs in the Family&rsquo; that I tried to veto, and, well, Ben won,&quot; Palmer says.  &quot;Other songs like &rsquo;Blake Says&rsquo; were written in my mid-twenties and had always had a place close to my heart &ndash I knew they had to go on the album. But Ben was really merciless about separating out the wheat from the chaff, and it really paid off. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single weak link on the record.&quot;  With the songs picked, recording commenced in marathon sessions in spring of 2007, with Ben Folds acting as producer and back-up one-man-band, and the creative process in full swing. <br />&quot;From there, the project stretched from a two week side project into a year-long epic project,&quot; she continues.  &quot;Ben was a madman in the studio. He had a wicked sense of humor and a perfect touch with sounds and ideas. He was able to see what I missed. I thought that &rsquo;Melissa Mahoney&rsquo; was too silly to go on the record&hellipI mean, come on, it&rsquo;s a pop song about abortion. But Ben took the joke, ran with it, added back-up singers and NAILED it to the wall. He knew exactly when to take an idea too far and when to pull back. The amount of magic he added to the songs is just unbelievable.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We weren&rsquo;t working with a strict deadline, so we got to try a lot of things and throw them away,&quot; Palmer continues.  This experimentation also gave Palmer the opportunity to invite some of her own favorite musicians to play on the songs, resulting in guest turns from the likes of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Annie Clark (on a twisted version of Carousel&rsquo;s &quot;What&rsquo;s the Use of Wondrin&quot;), The Dead Kennedys&rsquo; East Bay Ray and Rasputina&rsquo;s Zoe Keating. Mr. Folds, in addition to producing and arranging, played synthesizer, drums, organ and contributed some back-up vocals on the record. He also introduced Palmer to his trusted and critically-acclaimed string arranger Paul Buckmaster, who supplied gorgeous string and orchestral arrangements for four songs on the record and conducted the sessions at LA&rsquo;s historic Studio A at Capitol Records.<br /><br /><strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong>, titled after a Twin Peaks reference that has &quot;come to mean new things,&quot; according to Palmer, gives the listener an entirely new angle by which to view <strong>Amanda Palmer</strong> as a songwriter, vocalist, piano-player and arranger.  &quot;One thing that was always irritated me is that the Dolls get locked in the gimmick box by a lot of people. Many times they don&rsquo;t see past the fun and theatrics, they never actually find the music or experience us live, so they have little idea what the essence of the band is.&quot;  Palmer explains.  &quot;At the core, I&rsquo;m a songwriter and the Dolls are a rock band. We&rsquo;ve earned a great reputation for throwing wonderful events and making our shows feel like big parties, but I&rsquo;m hoping that people can see past that and assess me as a songwriter and performer instead of just a circus ringmaster. I do love that role - and I think the role is an important one - but it&rsquo;s important for me to wave and remind people that I&rsquo;m a human being before I step back into the ring.&quot;<br /><br />The songs on <strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong> do just that.  From the sweeping orchestral opener &quot;Astronaut&quot; to the wild choruses of &quot;Leeds United&quot; to the sinister pop of &quot;Melissa Mahoney,&quot; each song peels back multi-faceted layers of Amanda Palmer, revealing an unbelievably talented woman at the core.  &quot;&rsquo;Astronaut&rsquo; may be my hands-down favorite It feels most representative of where I&rsquo;ve gone as a songwriter,&quot; says Palmer when discussing the songs on the album of which she&rsquo;s proudest.  &quot;But the recording of &rsquo;Leeds United&rsquo; has a great story, which is part of what makes me love that song,&quot; she continues.  &quot;I had just written it and played it for Ben, and we were trying to figure out how we wanted to track it.  I was in Scotland playing at the Fringe Festival, and I had wanted to add the song to the live set, so I called a local trumpet player I knew to come to the venue with some horn-playing friends.  We had one rehearsal and they joined me that night, wearing no pants and lampshades on their heads, on stage for a piano-and-horns version of &rsquo;Leeds United.&rsquo;  It sounded so great that I wanted to capture the arrangement to send to Ben, so I booked us into a teeny, cheap little studio to cut a demo.  That scratch vocal was done in one take, and I&rsquo;d been smoking and drinking all week, since I was done with my engagement and living it up.  I knew there was no way anyone would ever hear it but Ben, but Ben loved it&hellipso it wound up on the record.  It took forever to track down all those Scottish guys to get them to sign releases.&quot; <br />Other songs have taken on new emotional depths as Palmer has seen them take different shapes once they&rsquo;ve hit the stage.  &quot;&rsquo;Strength Through Music,&rsquo; which was inspired by the school shootings at Columbine, took on this whole new quality when I worked it into the stage show with The Danger Ensemble, a performance art group from Australia who are going to be touring with me,&quot; says Palmer.  &quot;Watching actors on stage interpret the meaning of those lyrics was heartbreaking.&quot;   Palmer also collaborated with long-time friend and filmmaker Michael Pope on a film project based on six of the album&rsquo;s songs to be released in pieces in the weeks leading up to the record&rsquo;s street date.  &quot;We filmed &rsquo;Strength&rsquo; in the hallway of my high school with a bunch of teenage drama students. It was incredibly powerful, there were a lot of tears after we cut the first take.&quot;   The film project also includes clips for &quot;Astronaut,&quot; &quot;Guitar Hero,&quot; &quot;Ampersand,&quot; &quot;Runs in the Family&quot; and &quot;Point of It All.&quot;  Extra footage was shot to weave the songs into a complete 30 minute film that connects each song to the next and follows Palmer through a series of painful but liberating realizations.<br /><br /><strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong> evolved from a simple idea to an elaborate process culminating in the finest work of a varied, already-impressive career.  At its center are the words of a masterful story teller, a woman with a wry tongue and a penchant for bold confessionals.  In this way, it makes sense that for the album&rsquo;s liner notes and accompanying mystery concept and photo book, Palmer has teamed up with another artist who successfully merges many worlds into one: best-selling author Neil Gaiman, who is best known as the man who penned the Sandman comic series.  &quot;I met Neil through my good friend Jason Webley,&quot; she says. &quot;We really connected and became a quick little mutual admiration society.  I sent him an early draft of the album and he loved it. When I realized I wanted to release a companion book of bizarre photographs along with the record, I asked if he might want to write the text to a story called &rsquo;Who Killed Amanda Palmer,&rsquo; and he was jazzed at the idea.&quot;  Thus, <strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong> grows even further &ndash a story written within a story sung. Gaiman and Palmer plan to self-publish the book in a limited edition and plant hidden visual clues within the images for further hunting should the reader want to follow the mystery of Who Killed Amanda Palmer down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />Fans who have felt a kinship with Palmer &ndash and there are thousands who pore over her words in her personal blog every day &ndash will feel this bond strengthen even further due to the astonishing forthrightness and vulnerability in these songs.  Those who know the backstory of Palmer&rsquo;s personal struggles and musings will feel at home instantly Palmer has piled every reference, challenge and acceptance from her very vibrant life into this album, inviting the listener into her home, as well as her heart.  <strong><em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer</em></strong> sees our fearless heroine weaving together the many threads of her personality, her interests, her extensive artistic family, her astute, witty world observations and the stark openness of her feelings into a dynamic record that pushes emotional boundaries while staying true to its genius creator.  From <strong>Amanda Palmer</strong>, we would expect nothing less. <br /><br /><br /><br />', 2008, NULL),

(56, 'Anyone', '                             ANYONE was born from the smoldering remains of a highly experimental trio called SYLVIA in 1995.  Composed of Taylor Hawkins (Foo Fighters) on drums, Juano (Sky Cries Mary) on bass, and singer/songwriter/guitarist Riz Story, the bands short blurred life proved to be the embryo for what would later become the most innovative band of the new millennium.  Story found himself with no rhythm section when Hawkins left to pursue other career opportunities and Juano relocated to Seattle.  He began jamming with soft spoken New Jersey transplant Dave &quotNIPPLES&quot Murray.  Murray had grown tired of the stagnant musical forms back home and had come to Huntington Beach to find a band that could accommodate his power and still be sensitive to his finesse.  The search for a bassist ended when Story and Nipples encountered a strange creature that called itself STATIC. Discussions on the origin of the strange name were silenced when STATIC plugged in his instrument and proceeded to produce the loudest and most heavily distorted bass tone the two had ever heard.  Story then renamed the band ANYONE, a name that he&#39d been saving for his first-born child.  The band then self-released the critically acclaimed &quotLive Acid.&quot  One thousand copies were literally devoured by the Orange County scene in less than a month.  The LP featured 11 cuts all recorded live at the now legendary &quotTOGETHERMENT&quot party.  A large warehouse was secured and ornately decorated by the band, while a film crew was on hand to capture the performance.  The controversial documentary that resulted shocked the alternative underground.  The early buzz on the film, &quotTOGETHERMENT&quot had the media tagging Riz Story a real leader in the O.C. movement.  By 1999 ANYONE had become one of the most celebrated bands in Orange County, taking the Los Angeles Music Awards top honors for best band.  Shows were becoming mini festivals, with projections of Story&#39s films overhead while dancers writhed with the band on stage, all in a heavily decorated venue showered in candy and bits of paper containing propaganda.  The bands dynamic live presentation held these early audiences, which included a vast coming together of fans- rockers, surfers, ravers, punks- in awe.   ANYONE are looked upon as originators of a new sound and a new music scene emerging from Southern California.  Established bands such as Korn and Orgy have raved about this band publicly and Korn even tried to sign the band to their Elementree imprint, but Roadrunner beat them to the punch in late 1999.  In May of 2000 the band left for Seattle&#39s London Bridge studios to work with noted producer Rick Parasher (Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Blind Melon).  Story and Parasher co-produced 14 tracks.  An additional track was co-produced by Story and producer Andrew (MUDROCK) Murdock (Godsmack, Powerman 2000).  Mudrock was brought in to co-mix the album with Story.  The band felt that he could help capture the sonic bomb blast that had stunned live audiences and defined the band&#39s signature, revolutionary sound.  First listening reveals influences as broad as Zeppelin, Jane&#39s Addiction, and Pink Floyd.  The album is packed with trippy, experimental guitar riffs, funk/punk influenced bass lines and energetic, mood-setting drum tones.  Riz&#39s razor sharp voice cuts through each song, spitting out lyrics that demand the listener&#39s attention.  This album will open your mind to the explosive, worldly sound that is ANYONE.    The 16 songs that comprise Anyone&#39s debut are an eclectic array of moods expressed through sound.  The opening track, &quotGiving Thrills&quot is an invitation to become a part of the ANYONE experience. It causes the listener to face the reality of life as a collection of the ridiculous, to face the chaos.  &quotDon&#39t Wake Me&quot is a dreamer&#39s anthem full of sublimely controlled sonic debris.  &quotWhole World&#39s Insane&quot opens with primal screams and develops into a sound that is best described as musical insanity.  It is a song that leaves you with voices in your own head, repeating the catchy &quotUh-huh-a, Uh-huh-a&quot chorus long after the first listen is complete.  &quotHitches&quot is ANYONE&#39s term for obstacles or a problems that kept you from getting through the day.  It is a song laced with heavy down trodden guitar and bass riffs that serve as the background for Riz&#39s lacerating vocals.    11 months in the making, ANYONE&#39s self-titled album stands as an invitation to join in and embrace the sonic boom.  Great hooks, explosive energy, compelling lyrics and a totally unique and new soundï¿½ welcome to ANYONE.  ', 2002, NULL);

(58, 'Biffy Clyro', '                             <p>Drive for an hour so outside Glasgow, you&#39ll find an unassuming little town called Ayr. It&#39s a pretty but unremarkable place certainly not the sort of place you expect revolutions to start. But then, if we know anything about revolutions, it&#39s that they never happen quite when or where you expect.</p>    <p>You&#39ll have heard of <strong>biffy clyro</strong> before of course. About how Simon Neil and schoolfriend twins James and Ben Johnston formed their first band as young teenagers at school in the nearby town of Kilmarnock in 1995 over a shared love of experimental rock and hardcore. You&#39ll know something of how they earned an army of rabidly devotional fans - christened Team Biffy - who  followed them across the country and beyond, their hearts swelling with the searing emotion their minds expanded by the threesome&#39s inventive rock that somehow managed to hit them in the gut at the same time. And you&#39ll probably know about their three albums &#39Blackened Sky&#39, &#39The Vertigo Of Bliss&#39 and &#39Infinity Land&#39, which slowly - and on their own terms - saw them notch up higher and higher chart positions. </p>What you might not know is that in the two-and-a-half years since &#39Infinity Land&#39, they&#39ve been hard at work making what could just be the next truly, historically, important rock record to come out of the British Isles. It&#39s called <strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> and it&#39s  <p>coming your way. Of course, Simon Neil, James and Ben never actually stopped. During biffy&#39s brief hiatus, all three have been kept bust with extra-curricular underground work. And the experience of making some of the most &#39out-there&#39 music of their careers only fuelled their desire that when they did come back, it would be their biggest, best - but also strangest - yet.</p>    <p>To help them make <strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong>, they chose Canadian producer Garth Richardson, inspired by his work with Rage Against The Machine and Kerbdog, and an innate sense of his &quotgreat vibe.&quot The venture saw them fly to Vancouver, then to Richardson&#39s stunning ranch studio in the forests of Gibson to record their masterwork. The collaboration bore exceptional fruit, but the band admit it took time - after recording their previous three albums on a budget and at speed - to adapt to recording in the same way as their heroes.</p>    <p>Explains Simon: &quotFor the first week we had to really slow down how we were doing things. We&#39re used to a hundred miles an hour, but we would have burnt out after a week. We needed a lot more patience about it, but the results are worth it. It took Garth a few days to realise how headstrong we were. We&#39re up for collaborating, but this is our record and we very much are doing what we want to do. It took him a few days to realise that we were going to reject some of his ideas as much as we would collaborate.&quot</p>    <p>From Vancouver, they decamped to New York to mix the album with Andy Wallace - who also handled &#39Nevermind&#39. Artwork,  meanwhile, has been handled by Storm Thorgerson the man behind Classic Rock records both old (Pink Floyd) and new (Muse).</p>  <p>From the apocalyptic opener &#39Living Is A Problem Because Everything Dies&#39, its clear that they have out-biffed the biff. 2001 A Space Odyssey by way of Wagner and Rage Against The Machine, it boasts a stunning baroque choral arrangement and strings by Hollywood arranger Graeme Revell (&lsquoSin City&#39, &lsquoThe Crow&#39, &lsquoFrom Dusk Til Dawn&#39). It&#39s a gigantic, ostentatious raising of their game.</p>    <p>&quotWe&#39ve always been very ambitious in the music we wanted to make,&quot says Simon. &quotIt was never just about guitars bass and drums, even though we&#39re a three-piece. On our records we&#39ve always tried to use as much weird shit as possible.&quot</p><strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> has seen the band finally realise the sound in their heads, it also sees them anchor some of their most outlandish ideas (check the staggering &#399/15ths&#39 for evidence that they&#39ve done anything but gone soft) with the sort of clear and crisp  <p>melodies that this three-headed powerhouse have been hinting at since the days of &#39Justboy&#39 and &#3927&#39. From soaring download single &#39semi-mental&#39 through to the bludgeoning punch of &#39Saturday Superhouse&#39 through the swollen intensity of the slow-burning &#39As Dust Dances&#39 to the glorious foot-stomping live favourite &#39Who&#39s Got A Match?&#39, <strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> packs an emotional punch with 24-carat choruses shot through with biffy&#39s trademark sideways approach to songwriting.</p>    <p>The band admit that this new directness is the result of their searing five-year apprenticeship, working through their ideas and growing into a truly world-beating band. </p>      <p>&quotWe&#39d normally have maybe hidden moments like that before,&quot admits Simon. &quotMaybe because the lyrics are a bit more personal this time, it felt as though the music should breathe a bit more. A song like &#39As Dust Dances&#39, we&#39d just kind of played it and were hypnotising ourselves by playing it rather than trying to rock it up or anything it just felt right, the song&#39s hardly changed since you first heard it. We maybe wouldn&#39t have enjoyed playing that song five years ago, we&#39d have been so restless we wouldn&#39t have felt comfortable, but now we feel as though we can do that, and it works. Rather than trying to cram maybe 100 ideas into ten seconds, leaving them out it can sometimes make things better.&quot </p>  <p><strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> might be crammed with glorious rock songs designed to unite as many people as possible in the power of hard rock but lyrically it&#39s been an altogether more traumatic process. Written in the shadow of the loss of Simon&#39s mother, the album in many ways charts the process of Simon coming to terms with his feelings, and finding ways to move forward. And this is never more extreme than on the album&#39s devastating climax, &#39Machines&#39.</p>    <p>Says Simon: &quotIt&#39s about how your mind works after having a serious grievance in your life how at some points you&#39re really angry at yourself and everybody, at other points you just feel so sad and then you start imagining what death&#39s like and you</p>    <p>suddenly get these vivid pictures of what you think they&#39re gonna be, and then doubting yourself and feeling better and then having a bit of hope. The album&#39s not in that order, but that&#39s what&#39s going on.&quot </p>  <p>Above all, <strong><em>Puzzle</em></strong> is the definitive statement - so far - from a band that believers have always known would take on the world one day. The band themselves are far too humble to take notice of the increasing number of voices calling them &quotthe British</p>  <p>Nirvana&quot. What it does do is set a watermark, and usher in a new age of British hard rock in the same way &#39Nevermind&#39 did all those years ago. We just want to make records that people can listen to in 20 years and think they&#39re good fucking records,&quot says Simon in conclusion. &quotWe believe that if we follow what we want to do, which is very much our own take on things, that things will sound honest and real in 20 years time because there&#39s gonna be no schtick associated with it. We&#39re not dressed crazily, people stood up and took notice because we were making great music, and people had to stand up and pay attention, so I think if that can apply over three or four years, then I just hope that in 20 years it still applies. That&#39s what we want to do we want to be an important band. And we think we are.&quot</p>', 2007, NULL),
(59, 'Biohazard', '                             (taken from the liner notes of the 1998 reissue of <u>Urban Discipline</u>)  Six years after it was first released, <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> is still as fresh as the damage from a smoking gun, still as human as the ambulance crew that takes away another victim, still as angry as the friends that are left behind, and of course, still as loud and powerful as the initial blast. See, by capturing their own little piece of tough city life so well, <strong>Biohazard</strong> had, without even realizing it at the time, captured so many of our lives. As I write, thousands of miles from where this album was actually recorded, it&#39s with the knowledge that two friends will be buried this week. Next week it could be your friends who get killed or your kids playing in the chalk outlineï¿½ Even the sleeve to URBAN DISCIPLINE tells a story.  ï¿½The idea was that children are pure and untainted by society until society gets them,ï¿½ explains vocalist/bassist Evan Seinfeld, when we get to discussing the album exclusively for these notes. ï¿½Left to their own devices, children don&#39t see colour or religion or political affiliation or economics and they don&#39t care. On the sleeve, the kids are so innocent, they&#39re playing on a chalk outline of a murder scene completely unaware, and if you look closely, you&#39ll see the kid at the back has picked up the gun and to him its just a toy. You&#39re the one dealing with people being shot and killed today,ï¿½ says Evan, ï¿½Nobody I know got killed today and that&#39s a good day. Every day that happens is a blessing, but just open a newspaper or turn on the TVï¿½ï¿½  So <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> is a hard, streetwise album but that is merely a reflection of the hard streets that <strong>Biohazard</strong> walked. ï¿½<strong>Biohazard</strong> saved our lives in many ways,ï¿½ Evan admits. ï¿½We were all at the end of our lines in these dark, dismal places and than when we formed the band, I wasn&#39t Evan from Canarsie, Brooklyn any more, I was Evan from <strong>Biohazard</strong>.ï¿½  ï¿½But it wasn&#39t until <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> that we got out and saw the world,ï¿½ he adds. ï¿½So that album was basically about the urban struggle and growing up in a city in 1992. And it&#39s kinda timeless in a way &#39cos the songs mean more than ever today. There&#39s a real dark side to the album, but there&#39s also a unity and a powerful, hopeful side to it too.&quot  Indeed, each song on <u>Urban Discipline</u> has its own unique strength and a refusal to bow down or be beaten.  For each dark moment like ï¿½Tears Of Bloodï¿½ or ï¿½Loss,ï¿½ there is a glimmer of light, none brighter than the title track itself.  ï¿½The reason we put songs on albums, at least back then,ï¿½ smiles Evan ï¿½was to share a message and use it as a therapeutic way of getting rid of the angst we were living with at the time, and still dance to itï¿½  And among the many classic hardcore tracks on this album is ï¿½Black And White And Red All Over,ï¿½ the song that put an end to the frankly ridiculous rumors that <strong>Biohazard</strong> were racists.  ï¿½Well it was fucking hilarious to us that were rumors about us,ï¿½ laughs Evan ruefully. ï¿½We like to ride the controversial edge, but anyone who knows our nationalities, religions or political affiliations - they would never even have considered the idea I mean, how about the fact that Danny (Schuler ï¿½ drums) and I are Jewish? It&#39s a bit of a giveaway that I&#39m not a Nazi!ï¿½  ï¿½At the time <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> came out,ï¿½ recalls Evan, ï¿½even though we had &#39Howard Beach&#39 on the first album, there weren&#39t a lot of bands looking at political issues and really attacking them in our genre of music. I think we were one of the first bands to offer an awareness and maybe not a solution, but just that we can rise above it on an individual basis. That&#39s how you change the world, with one person, then one more, then another. We just sing about our experiences, our fears, our hopes, our strengths and our weaknesses and I think it&#39s very honest. You don&#39t have to be from Brooklyn to understand it. <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> was an angry time man, an angry time. I don&#39t think the world has changed that much, maybe a little bitï¿½ï¿½  ï¿½But things have changed a lot for us,ï¿½ notes Evan with rightful pride.ï¿½ When we were recording <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u>, <strong>Biohazard</strong> was still just an idea and now it&#39s something we do full time, it&#39s our lives.ï¿½  It&#39s kind of hard to imagine <strong>Biohazard</strong> working day jobs, but back then Evan was delivering building materials, Danny was working in a stockroom, Billy (Graziadei -vocals/guitar) was driving a truck and Christ only knows what then-guitarist Bobby Hambel was doing.  ï¿½We recorded <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> pretty fast with a guy named Wharton Tiers at Fun City Studios on the East Side,ï¿½ remembers Evan fondly. ï¿½It was so <strong>Biohazard</strong>, like, the drums were recorded in the bathroom and the vocals were done in the kitchen with no lights and all the dirty dishes in the sink that looked like they&#39d been there for five years. Everything was home-made, which is kinda how <strong>Biohazard</strong> is and it was definitely a great time.ï¿½  In 1992, no one could have known what a huge effect <strong>Biohazard</strong> would have on the music world, eventually going on to influence the likes of Prodigy, while all the time retaining their underground roots, and of course, massive, ever-loyal worldwide following. In 1998 they are justly proud of their achievement and of this stepping stone album.  ï¿½I would have to say that <u>URBAN DISCIPLINE</u> is the definitive <strong>Biohazard</strong> album,ï¿½ considers Evan. ï¿½It embodied a very powerful balance of raw unbridled energy, band focus and our diverse musical tastes. The album goes through all the flavors that are <strong>Biohazard</strong> and sets the stage for what&#39s to come with <u>STATE OF THE WORLD ADDRESS</u>, <u>MATA LEAO</u> and even the album we&#39re working on right now. It&#39s great to be able to go back and look at what you did with hindsight, but the important thing is that this is an album we&#39re very proud of and if you really want to know about the album, stop reading this and put it on.ï¿½   You heard the man.

(60, 'Black Label Society', '                             &ampquotI dig working,&quot says Zakk Wylde. &ampquotYou can bitch and moan sometimes about having too much on your plate, but it&#39s gotta get done, and this is what I do.&quot <br /><br />It&#39s a good thing Zakk likes to work, because he may well be one of the hardest-working men in music right now. On top of helping Ozzy Osbourne write songs for his next record, he&#39s just putting the finishing touches on <em>Shot To Hell</em>, his first <strong>Black Label Society</strong> album for <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>. Produced by Zakk and Michael Beinhorn (Ozzy, Korn, Soundgarden), and recorded with longtime pals Craig Nunenmacher (drums) and John &ampquotJ.D.&quot DeServio (bass), <em>Shot To Hell</em> takes the ferocious hard rock of such <strong>BLS</strong> albums as 2003&#39s Blessed Hellride and 2005&#39s <em>Mafia</em> to a whole new level of &ampquotbrewtality.&quot<br /><br />&ampquotI never run out of ideas,&quot Zakk says. &ampquotWe just came in here and started knocking it out. That&#39s how you make records.&quot That take-no-prisoners attitude is all over such snarling tracks as &ampquotConcrete Jungle,&quot &ampquotBlood Is Thicker Than Water&quot and &ampquotGive Yourself To Me,&quot while reflective ballads like &ampquotLead Me To Your Door&quot and &ampquotSick Of It All&quot mix moody melodies with screaming guitar solos. &ampquotIt&#39s a real cool mix of heavy shit and mellow shit,&quot Zakk explains.<br /><br />During the recording of <em>Shot To Hell</em>, Zakk and crew turned Ameraycan Studios in North Hollywood, CA into a cross between a Guitar Center and a teenage boy&#39s bedroom. &ampquotWe had a Mellotron in here, a Hammond B-3, a ton of Marshalls and just about every guitar I own,&quot Zakk recalls. &ampquotIt looked like Sanford and Son out in the parking lot - a whole garage-sale going on with the equipment, you know? And we had pictures taped up on the walls of Randy Rhoads and Jimmy Page, just for inspiration, because you&#39ve still gotta listen to music with a fourteen-year-old&#39s ears. Remembering when you were like, &#39Dude, we&#39re going to see Zeppelin this weekend!&#39- that&#39s what it&#39s all about, man. Because once you lose that, then you shouldn&#39t be doing it anymore.&quot<br /><br />In the two decades since Ozzy plucked him from obscurity (at a gas station job in New Jersey) and hired him to be his new guitarist, Zakk has established himself as a guitar icon on the same level as Rhoads, Page and Eddie Van Halen, thanks to the impressive work he&#39s done with Ozzy, as a solo artist, and as the leader of Pride &amp Glory and <strong>Black Label Society </strong>. He&#39s won practically every guitar magazine award there is, and he&#39s regularly cited as a major influence by the latest wave of metal guitarists. For Zakk, such recognition is humbling and gratifying, especially since he and his late pal Dimebag Darrell were about the only guitarists still flying the flag for seriously shredding solos during the nu-metal Nineties. <br /><br />&ampquotMe and Dime would always say to each other, &#39Are we the only two assholes who can still get from low E to high E and back safely? Does anyone even practice scales anymore?&#39&quot Zakk says with a laugh. &ampquotBut if what I do inspires some kid to pick up a guitar and jam, that&#39s the shit, without a doubt. You can always get better, though that&#39s how I look at it. You never turn your back on practicing - that&#39s what got you where you&#39re at. You could be the heavyweight champion of the world, but you&#39ve still gotta train, you&#39ve still gotta focus on what got you there. When you lose sight of that, then everything just falls to shit. I&#39ll tell ya, brother, I talk to God every day, and thank him for everything I&#39ve got.&quot<br /><br />Indeed, Zakk has plenty to be thankful for. Despite his gruff exterior and rowdy reputation, he&#39s a devoted family man who&#39s still married to Barbaranne, his high school sweetheart, and who dotes lovingly on his three children and his seven dogs. <br /><br />&ampquotPeople say, &#39Zakk, you must get a lot of chicks,&#39 and I always laugh,&quot he reflects. &ampquotWhen you&#39ve got filet mignon at the house, why would you go to McDonald&#39s? I mean, I&#39ve got buddies with chicks in every town, but I&#39d rather just go to a pub and relax, talk to the bartender and solve the problems of the world. This business is like being in an insane asylum, and you need time to relax and get away from it all. What works for me is being with my family, drinking a beer, hanging out, and lifting weights.&quot <br /><br />The summer of 2006 figures to be a busy one for Zakk. Not only will <strong>Black Label Society</strong> be headlining the Second Stage at Ozzfest, but he&#39ll be playing guitar for Ozzy&#39s selected Ozzfest appearances. &ampquotOzzy&#39s scheduled to do about ten shows,&quot he says, &ampquotbut I know him - if he&#39s having a good time, and his voice feels fine, he&#39s gonna wanna keep doing more. I&#39ve got no problem with that, because I love playing with him.&quot <br /><br /><strong>Black Label</strong>&#39s Ozzfest appearances are certain to draw a large contingent of what Zakk terms &ampquotThe Brotherhood&quot - <strong>Black Label</strong>&#39s network of diehard fans, who sport their <strong>BLS</strong> &ampquotcolors&quot and local chapter affiliations at every show. &ampquotIt&#39s just like one big family,&quot Zakk says. &ampquotThe beauty of it is that it&#39s bigger than me, it&#39s bigger than the band. It&#39s become a lifestyle - just like how Harley-Davidson is more than a motorcycle. All the chapters come down to the shows we all hang out and take the piss out of each other - the Boston chapter roaches my ass all the time, because they know I&#39m a Yankee guy. And whenever we&#39re near a big city on Ozzfest, we&#39ll check and see if there&#39s a baseball game happening that night, and we&#39ll round up our troops from the local chapter and hit a game.&quot<br /><br />Zakk&#39s a major sports fan, and an ardent supporter of the Yankees, New York Giants, New York Knicks and New Jersey Devils. Baseball legend Mike Piazza is the godfather of Zakk&#39s son, Hendrix, and Zakk has had the honor of playing the National Anthem at Dodger Stadium, Shea Stadium, Staples Center and Madison Square Garden. &ampquotWhenever I play it, the home team always wins,&quot Zakk laughs. &ampquotIf I can keep my streak up, I won&#39t have to perform live anymore - I&#39ll just hire myself out to play the National Anthem. The phone&#39s definitely gonna get busy around playoff time!&quot<br /><br />Happily for fans of gut-busting, ear-blasting, engine-revving rock and roll, Zakk won&#39t be retiring from performing or recording any time soon. If <em>Shot To Hell</em> is any indication, <strong>Black Label Society</strong> still has plenty of juice left in the bottle.', 2006, NULL),

Or better yet, what do we actually know about these masked musicians from South-of-the-border?  The name,&quot;Brujeria,&quot; derives from the black magic used by some Mexican Drug dealers to inspire Fear in religious locals.  It is said that these very same Satanic, murderous drug dealers came together to make the music on Brujerizmo, their own brand of &rsquo;machete metal&rsquo;  that is both original and brutal.<br><br>In September of 1990, a bizarre 7&quot; single from an unknown independent record label hit the shelves in the United States. All songs were sung in the Spanish language, and the music was among the most extreme heard to date .  It wasn&rsquo;t long before the distributor of the record began receiving orders of 50-100, to single individuals who were purchasing the discs and exporting them personally to Mexico, and other countries in Latin America.<br><br>Since Roadrunner Records made their dangerous deal with this murderous crew to release of their full length cds &quot;Matando Gueros&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Raza Odiata&quot; in 1995, BRUJERIA has emerged at the forefront of underground Latin music, and has become well known worldwide. SubCommandante Marcos even began wearing their t-shirts. In Jan.2000,  the band enjoyed the #1 spot on Mexico&rsquo;s largest commercial station Radioactiva for three weeks.  <br><br>BRUJERIA&rsquo;s success runs contrary to convention in the recording industry: they sold almost 25,000 records (Matando Gueros) worldwide in spite of their refusal to: <br><br>a)Tour, <br>b)Use real names, <br>c)Take photos (without masking their identities), <br>d)Do interviews.  <br><br>Many thought they had disappeared forever after Raza Odiada.  But have Faith,  Brujeria are back!  No less angry, the band has lost none of its venom, spewing forth tirades on everything from AIDS to Castro.  On their third Roadrunner release, Brujerizmo, they bombard you with 13 tracks of straight ahead aggression.  While they remain an enigma, some say that BRUJERIA  is made up of members from such metal stalwarts as Fear Factory, Napalm Death, Cradle of Filth, the late great Faith No More and Dimmu Borgir others believe it to be a creation of an underground political organization.

(63, 'Carnivore', '                             Imagine you are one of the few unlucky survivors of a global thermonuclear war. The peaceful environment you once knew has been completely obliterated, and your new home is underneath the surface of the earth, free from the deadly contaminants that have turned the earth above into a radioactive wasteland. But those of you who are forced to spend your few remaining days groping in the underground darkness are not the only survivors, for up on the surface a vicious horde of cannibalistic warriors roam - waiting for you to stick your decaying skull out of the ground in hopes of catching a glimpse of the world above. Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you begin to inch your way out of the dirt. Within seconds you are snatched from the ground and devoured by the neo-barbaric carnivores, and you are only quite thankful to be spared the horror of survival. <br><br>Whether this gruesome scene is mere fiction or a prophetic glimpse into our dismal future is not important. You need not wait for World War III to annihilate civilization as we know it - one listen to either of Carnivore&rsquo;s two classic exercises in post-nuclear metal (Carnivore and Retaliation), and you will quickly find yourself trapped in an underground nightmare, avoiding the walking terror above. <br><br>If we can stop heading the doom of tomorrow for a bit and take a few steps backward, we see that the frightening image of these nomadic predators was actually a vision inside the mind of vocalist/bassist Peter Steele back in 1983, the year that marked the birth of Carnivore. Natives of Brooklyn, NY, Carnivore spent their early years earning a reputation as one of the area&rsquo;s most dangerous bands. Crowds would stare in utter shock as these instrument-wielding warriors would take the stage clad in futuristic outfits that typified the meaning of Carnivore. Dressed to the hilt in fur-covered shoulder pads, spikes, hockey equipment, nails and anything that gave them the appearance of flesh-eating monsters, Carnivore frequently drenched the front rows of their audiences with blood, brains and innards, provoking a maniacal reaction like frenzied sharks being taunted with buckets of chum. <br><br>In 1985, the deranged chaos of Carnivore was finally contained in vinyl, as their self-titled debut album surfaced from beneath the tainted earth. Based primarily around the concept of life after a thermonuclear war, Carnivore grabbed its listener by the balls and thrust them into a corrupt society where rape, murder and cannibalism were accepted as means of survival.<br><br>With the release of their first album, Carnivore quickly found themselves loved by large masses locally, and hated by just as many. Those totally offended by this ensemble of musical destruction showed no mercy in releasing their outrage, as the hulking 6&rsquo;6&quot; Steele occasionally received mail in the form of boxed cockroaches and dog feces. According to Peter, &quot;People either said that we were great or that we sucked dick- but they never said that we sucked dick to my face!&quot; This man could very well be the most frightening figure in music-one look and you&rsquo;ll understand why. One listen and you&rsquo;ll feel why. <br><br>This brings us to the second and what would be the final Carnivore album, &quot;Retaliation&quot; (fall &rsquo;87). As the band headed into more hardcore music and image territory, they felt it best to abandon the costumes and science-fiction attitude in favor of a more straight-from-the-heart approach. Peter allowed his deepest feelings to ooze from the grooves of &quot;Retaliation&quot;, as he touched on subjects ranging from racial tension (&quot;Race war&quot;), gang warfare (&quot;Sex and Violence&quot;), patriotism (&quot;U.S.A. for U.S.A.&quot;) and intense anxiety (&quot;Inner Conflict&quot;).<br><br>Following the release of &quot;Retaliation&quot;, Carnivore were at the peak of their career, and they were on the verge of breaking free from the confines of Brooklyn and spreading their brand of nuclear mayhem across the rest of the globe. But in February &rsquo;88, at the height of popularity, personal problems within the group surfaced and a rotting stench permeated the Brooklyn air, signifying the extinction of the deadly Carnivore. <br><br>Now, nearly three years later, Peter again lurks the Earth above, this time fronting a brilliant new band that can be looked as the next dimension of Carnivore: Subzero. Quite possibly the finest new band to emerge from under the streets of New York City, Subzero (Peter-vocals/bass, Kenny-guitar, Josh-keyboards, Sal-drums), pick up where Carnivore left off, taking the Carnivore foundation to new and exciting extremes engulfing the listener in a glorious world of musical anger, destruction, pain and spine-chilling fear. <br><br>Carnivore may now only exist as a memory, but as long as you listen, you are free to walk through the rest of your days with the twisted ideology as your co-pilot: &quot;If you can&rsquo;t eat it or fuck it, then kill it!&quot;<br><br>Note: since time of writing, Subzero has become Type O Negative<br>', 2001, NULL),
(64, 'Chimaira', '                             &quotThis isn&#39t a &#39first listen&#39 record,&quot says <strong>Chimaira</strong> frontman Mark Hunter. &quotThe songs will stick in your head for the rest of your life, but it&#39s not dumbed down. People are going to listen and say, &#39This is interesting. I need to hear it again.&#39 By the third time they listen, they will go, &#39Whoa, I &#39get&#39 it.&#39&quot <br /><br />Those are bold statements, but Hunter and <strong>Chimaira</strong> thoroughly back it up on their new album, appropriately titled <em>Chimaira</em>. It&#39s fitting that this wrecking crew have named their third full length, <em>Chimaira</em>. That&#39s because this Cleveland sextet have fine tuned and honed their style so deftly, that this album truly represents everything they were, everything they are, and everything they are poised to become once this monster is unleashed on the heavy metal world. <br /><br /><em>Chimaira</em> is Chimaira, from the opening note of the brain damagingly heavy &quotNothing Remains,&quot which Hunter reveals was written the day Dimebag Darrell was murdered, saying &quotThe song has nothing to do with the situation, but musically, it&#39s brutal and anger-filled, and the shooting brought out the feelings. We sat in the practice space, staring at the ground for an hour, when Rob picked up his guitar, and the song was just born.&quot The heaviness quotient doesn&#39t lessen, thanks to the brutal breakdown present on &quotSave Ourselves,&quot which feels like a mortar grinding your skull and bones into a fine powder. &quotSalvation&quot is the album&#39s most melodic song, due in part to the enormous chorus. The album&#39s closer is the epic, dynamic mindfuck called &quotLazarus.&quot It&#39s the &quotmost roller coaster track. It&#39s not about the Biblical character, but a friend who committed suicide 11 years ago. It&#39s the most personal song I&#39ve ever written, and I got it out of my system,&quot Hunter says, admitting he envisions kids listening to the song on headphones, to fully absorb it.<br /><br />Hunter continues, saying, &quotThe lyrics are really personal, and fans looking for a &#39Fuck you,&#39 or a &#39Power Trip&#39 type song will be disappointed. This is more thought-out, more realistic. I thought it was time to be upfront in my lyrics and strip away the ambiguity.&quot That makes the lyrics a perfect complement to the music, which directly connects like a series of punches to the groin. <br /><br />When <strong>Chimaira</strong> commenced the writing process, they were coming off a marathon, two-year road trek in support of their most successful album, <em>The Impossibility Of Reason</em>. They had toured as headliners, with Lamb Of God, as well as with <em>Ozzfest</em> 2003, <em>Jagermeister</em> Spring 2004, which featured Slipknot and Fear Factory, and co-headlined the Summer 2004 <em>Road Rage</em> tour with Machine Head. The played a spate of European festivals and clocked 330 shows in 21 countries. &quotWe were eager to write new material,&quot says Hunter. &quotWhile we were touring, we didn&#39t think there would be pressure. We thought it would be a breeze. But when we sat down to do it, we were like deer in the headlights. It took a month of toying with ideas.&quot They joined up with Ben Schigel for the second time, recording at Spider Studios.<br /><br />On <em>Chimaira</em>, the band refused to write songs that fit any stylistic format. Most of the songs on Chimaira hover at the five-minute and over mark, making it clear that they evolved through a natural progression rather than a preconceived notion. &ldquoWe were trying to not have any restraints. If it was a 1 and a half-minute song and or a 15-minute song, as long as we were happy, that&#39s all that mattered. The songs are as long as necessary, in order to get the point across.&rdquo<br /><br />The band contends that <em>Chimaira</em> is Chimaira at their most musical, and that the solos ripped out by guitarist Rob Arnold are unlike anything on previous records. Hunter&#39s screaming is much more intimidating and Chris Spicuzza&#39s ambient/electronic element has added an additional, yet crucial layer to Chimaira&#39s sound. Hunter says, &quotChris took epic parts and made them more epic. You&#39ll ask yourself, &#39Why does this sound so big?&#39 That&#39s our trick!&quot New drummer Kevin Talley, who cut his teeth in death metal bands Misery Index and Dying Fetus, is more of a brutal, in your face live drummer, and Talley&#39s intensity is omnipresent on the recorded album as much as it is on stage. &quotYou can&#39t deny that the drums are ripping your head off. These sound ferocious,&quot Hunter says.<br /><br />The addition of Talley and <strong>Chimaira</strong>&#39s progression as individuals and a band are what give Chimaira its fresh, invigorated feel. &quotEveryone put their two cents in,&quot Hunter explains. &quotEveryone contributed their flavor and style. So, it&#39s truly a Chimaira record. We&#39re like the three-headed beast - we&#39re disagreeing animals forming into one monster.&quot And what a monster it is.', 2001, NULL),
(65, 'CKY', '                             <p>What happens when four exceedingly different and distinct personalities come together to create heated, inspired music? Well, as CKY have shown over their ten plus years as a rock and roll force, it can lead to intelligent, provoking riffs and lyrics, meticulously detailed production combined with magical multi-textured melodies and heady drumming. But, &quot;it also creates tension, tension that <em>must</em> be let off,&quot; says the band&rsquo;s singer/guitarist, <strong>Deron Miller</strong>. <strong></strong></p><br><p>Not too long ago, ten years of tension caught up with the West Chester, Pennsylvania outfit. Producer/guitarist <strong>Chad I Ginsburg</strong> says the band &quot;ended up physically beating each other up at once on their tour bus,&quot; CKY decided to take an extended timeout. &quot;We needed a break, more than just the kind of break you think,&quot; explained Miller. A break leaving drummer<strong> Jess Margera </strong>and bassist <strong>Matt Deis </strong>wondering what future, if any, there would be for CKY.&quot;</p><br><p>The band were halfway through the writing of their forthcoming album, <strong><em>Carver City</em></strong> (which was recorded and produced by Ginsburg at his new Studio CIG in Pennsylvania), CKY found itself unable to resolve internal issues, resulting in the band being put on the backburner. For an entire year, Ginsburg and Miller did not speak, nor did Miller and Margera. This extremely uncomfortable time away from the thing they loved most would allow the band to overcome the many lingering obstacles standing in the way of their greatest effort to date, <em>Carver City</em>, which hits stores May 19.</p><br><p>&quot;We could have just said, &lsquoFuck it. We&rsquo;re not going to finish the record.&rsquo; But no one could make that decision.&quot; says Ginsburg. &quot;When we finally got together to resume the sessions, we didn&rsquo;t talk about the past or what had happened. We didn&rsquo;t look back. The passion came back blazing, in a distinctly different, effective and inspiring way. Yeah, We took a year off by accident. But, I really think it helped the music greatly.&quot;</p><br><p><em><br /> Carver City</em> is CKY&rsquo;s first album of new material since 2005&rsquo;s <em>An Answer Can Be</em> <em>Found</em>, and the band&rsquo;s first studio offering since its split from Island Records in 2006. <br /> &quot;Having a studio at my house, gave me the ability to work on [<em>Carver City</em>] for literally several thousand hours, for two years straight,&quot; Ginsburg says. &quot;We added a ton of new textures. Layering has always been something we&rsquo;ve been into guitar textures alone tend to bore us, [<em>Carver City</em>] is sonically, our best effort to date.&quot;<br /> <br /> Thematically, <em>Carver City </em>is part fantasy, part autobiography. To assist in the completion of the album, CKY concocted the fictional town of Carver City to help them. Miller and Ginsburg inhabited this imagined municipality with notoriously bad luck with dozens of illusory characters, and even created an elaborate history behind Carver. At its heart, <em>Carver City</em> is a late 1970&rsquo;s/early 80&rsquo;s-era seaside resort town, much like Wildwood, New Jersey - a place Miller visited often with his family when he was a child. The song &quot;The Boardwalk Body&quot; was directly inspired by one such visit, when Miller says police discovered a corpse underneath the boardwalk.</p><br><p>&quot;Lyrically and musically, it all reminded us of that nostalgic beach vacation feeling,&quot; Miller says.</p><br><p><em>Carver City (</em>which features album art by Travis Smith) is perhaps CKY&rsquo;s most challenging and creatively gratifying endeavor to date. Conceiving Carver City and its folklore helped the band complete what was becoming an exhaustive writing/recording process, at a time when they were still recovering from their near-meltdown.&nbsp The band is back on solid ground again, back with a vengeance and a record that the band&rsquo;s allegiant fans will appreciate. As Ginsburg puts it &quot;the world didn&rsquo;t end, CKY still exist and are better than ever.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;Trying to please each other and ourselves...that&rsquo;s always the challenge,&quot; says Ginsburg. &quot;We wouldn&rsquo;t release a note at this point if we didn&rsquo;t dig what we were doing. This whole record was done basically without speaking to each other. It was just the music, and work, work, work all the time, with no bullshit. Learning to solely communicate through the music alone was tough but I know we did the right thing taking our time with <em>Carver City</em>.&quot;</p><br><p>This summer, to coincide with the resurgence of CKY and the release of <em>Carver City</em>, Ginsburg, Miller, Margera and Deis will be hitting the road bringing the unique energy and atmosphere that only a CKY show can.</p><br><p>&nbsp</p>', 2009, NULL),
(66, 'Coal Chamber', '                             &quot;Bands today are tapping into kids&rsquo; emotions and using them, using their souls for their own gain. Sure, I care about record sales, but not if I have to exploit my fans to get them.  I want to empower my fans and give them wings of metal and steel, wings to help them fly over this world we&rsquo;re in right now.  This is a crazy world, and a little bit of empowerment can go a long way.&quot;<br><br>So says Coal Chamber frontman Dez Fafara, further proving that in the depraved world of hard rock and heavy metal, we can rest assured that some things never change. Sure, the horrific charm of new release <u>Dark Days</u> shows a marked maturity over the more simplistic grooves of his band&rsquo;s 1997 debut and the more self-inflated sounds of their 1999 follow-up <u>Chamber Music</u>, but that sonic growth spurt couldn&rsquo;t hamper the force that has driven Coal Chamber since their inception practically a decade ago.<br><br>&quot;The kids are really the only reason we play,&quot; agrees drummer Mike Cox.  &quot;Sure, the easy answer is that it&rsquo;s for the love of music, but if it weren&rsquo;t for the kids and the fans, we wouldn&rsquo;t be out there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&rsquo;s really easy to make a kid cry and bum them out about their life when they&rsquo;re locked in their room. &quot;Those emotions are easy to tap,&quot; says Fafara of the lyrics that bog modern metal, &quot;but it&rsquo;s much harder to get a kid into a heavy band, get them to come to your show, get them involved in the pit, see them fall down, and watch them get picked up by the other kids and actually feel like they&rsquo;re a part of something for the first time in their life.&quot; The frontman remembers what it feels like to be a part of something bigger than the constrictive glare of the world around us. He lived it, and heavy metal was his escape. &quot;It&rsquo;s really too easy to breed self-doubt and self-hatred, but it&rsquo;s harder to breed self-confidence and power into kids. That&rsquo;s where I want to go.&quot;<br><br>If you were there when Coal Chamber first burst to prominence little more than five years ago, you remember the one word that the band kept repeating, &quot;Longevity”. Arriving on a heavy music scene when there hardly was a heavy music scene, Coal Chamber were at the forefront of what is now called the nu-metal movement. They bled heavy metal heroics with hip-hop-laden rhythms and the guitar-driven ferocity of Miguel Rascon. They were leaders in the first wave that helped create the modern metal scene and let nothing get in the way of the longevity that fueled their music.<br><br>In 2002, that word not only bears repeating, but actually means something more to the Southern California quartet. &quot;We&rsquo;re looking at the long term.  The one thing that I&rsquo;m most pleased with about Coal Chamber is that we can back up our album sales as a live draw,&quot; says Fafara. With three albums under the band&rsquo;s belt, they&rsquo;re one of the more veteran acts on the modern hard rock circuit, and that fact isn&rsquo;t lost on them. &quot;We wanted to do something that stepped out of the box and was diversified with this album, something that was raw and inspirational, something that isn&rsquo;t in the mainstream right now.&rsquo;&quot;<br><br>The results are profound, as <u>Dark Days</u> strikes the nerves like an air raid, a sonic landscape of turbo-charged guitars and throbbing bass lines, laid in a wake of penetrating drums and razor-sharp, iodine soaked vocals. Coal Chamber have expanded on their song writing abilities by putting together an album that melds thought provoking lyrics with their signature sound to construct songs that sound just as raw and energetic live as they do recorded.  <br><br>&quot;I started building a home studio and writing demos on my own, and when we got together, parts would start bleeding into other parts and they&rsquo;d all get bastardized,&quot; says Rascon of the writing process that led to <u>Dark Days</u>. &quot;It was more a case of people doing things on their own than on the previous records.  Everyone has the advantage of home studios, and it was a lot easier for us to write that way.  Although we were individuals in the development stages of the record, we came together as a group to record the songs.  It was a different way to do things, but what came out was killer. It was a very tough and fatiguing record, and we were meticulous in a lot of parts.  We did a lot to make sure that we don&rsquo;t sound like everyone else. It was a hard record to make, but it was satisfying in the end.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&rsquo;re a rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll band, and we still have rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll problems, and to say that we&rsquo;re all diverse isn&rsquo;t even the beginning of it, but that diversity is the character of this band, and that&rsquo;s all we care about at this point,&quot; boasts Fafara. &quot;Everyone&rsquo;s got such a unique style at this point, that when we come together that&rsquo;s what makes Coal Chamber what it is. We&rsquo;re such different people, it&rsquo;s crazy, but the music, especially on this album, was on point and we did what we had to do.&quot;<br><br>Even the recent departure of founding bassist Rayna Foss-Rose (who chose to leave the band to devote her full attention to her young daughter) can&rsquo;t distract from the results that the quartet had when they wrote and recorded the songs that comprise <u>Dark Days</u>. &quot;We wanted to make an album that you can listen to ten years from now and not have pigeonholed in any kind of scene, an album that, ten years from now, will still hold its valor and strength.&quot;<br><br>From the electro-driven pulse of the haunting &quot;Fiend,&quot; to the bitter, personal scorn released on &quot;Friend,&quot; there&rsquo;s not a track on the album that doesn&rsquo;t embrace the band&rsquo;s goal of being &quot;hard hitting, forboding, simple and grooving.&quot; The combination sounds basic enough, but until you&rsquo;ve basked in the rapture of &quot;Glow,&quot; there&rsquo;s no telling what you&rsquo;ve been missing. Close your eyes, and picture Fafara, Rascon, Cox, and returning bassist Nadja Puelen (who filled in for Foss-Rose when she took a maternity leave in 1999) the way they intended the music to be, &quot;Live”.<br><br>&quot;Before we just wrote songs, but now our songs have to work live,&quot; says the frontman. &quot;I&rsquo;m a really humble, down-to-earth guy, but I will say this &rsquo;Live, we&rsquo;re hard to touch.&rsquo;  We were trained by going on the road with bands like Black Sabbath and Pantera, bands that it meant something to go onstage before.

Of the band&rsquo;s longevity, frontman and original member Dani Filth, who joined the band at the ripe old age of 18, says, &quot;I can get a <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> tattoo and not feel embarrassed,&quot; with his trademark, self-deprecating English wit on full display. <br /><br />Through the years, there have been many critically-acclaimed releases, marathon tour cycles and spurts of controversy, simply because the Grammy-nominated <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> refuse to blend into the nefarious scene which birthed them. <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> welcome raised eyebrows and second looks from those who don&rsquo;t quite &quot;get&quot; what they do. <br /><br />The band opened doors for a scene that is no longer as fringe or sectarian as it once was. They&rsquo;ve taken a sledgehammer and smashed away at new ground. They&rsquo;ve maintained a steady pace, while so many of their peers have imploded, crashed and burned.<br /><br />So, how exactly, has <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> managed to outlast &rsquo;em all and arrive at their latest album, the controversially dark fairy tale, <strong><em>Godspeed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder</em></strong>? Simple. By doing what they&rsquo;ve always done and spiking their sonic punch with ethereal keyboards, bloodcurdling screams, riffs that can make lightning shoot from your bedroom walls and a fictionalised re-imagining of a decidedly troubled historical figure from the late Middle Ages: Gilles de Rais. (More on him in a moment!)<br /><br />&quot;We&rsquo;ve survived [all those black metal] episodes because we were more mature than other people were at the time,&quot; Dani says. &quot;We&rsquo;re not being big headed by saying that. We were English and had a tract of water separating us from other black metal bands. We&rsquo;re still one of few English black metal bands. We have had line up changes that have helped. Our fans understand that. People want to find a chink in the armour regarding line up changes, but it&rsquo;s utter crap! I think we endure because we explore every facet of our art. We were into this aesthetic before forming a band and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a hard thing to do if you are into it. All things that surround the nucleus of the band &ndashthe nucleus being the music&mdashlike our look, lyrics, how we portray ourselves on stage and our artwork, tie in all these dark elements.&quot;<br /><br />Indeed, <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> offers fans a full sensory experience and there are certainly no grey areas in their blend of black metal. It&rsquo;s loud. It&rsquo;s fast. It&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s subversive.   Dani continues, saying, &quot;We never shy away from saying or doing outrageous things, but on the flip side, it&rsquo;s never contrived.&quot;<br /><br />One thing that is outrageous but certainly not contrived is the not-for-the-faint-of-heart concept that <strong><em>Godspeed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder</em></strong> orbits around.  The album is a dark fairytale centering on Gilles de Rais, the French nobleman who carved out his place in history as a brother-in-arms of Joan of Arc, as well as a prolific, sick and twisted serial killer who began his life as a devout, pious man before devolving into full-fledged evil. De Rais, also an alchemist who squandered his vast fortune, was eventually hanged for his crimes against humanity, especially children. This is sensitive material, but <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> handle it with signature aplomb.  Rather than glamorising or glorifying de Rais, the band found an artistic way to explore his story.<br /><br />&quot;Read the lyrics,&quot; Dani encourages. &quot;It would have been so bloody easy to have gone overboard when writing about his crimes, which was really sick stuff. I would not put my daughter in a role on the record&mdashshe does a nursery rhyme and her laughter appears on the album&mdashif we hadn&rsquo;t handled the material with kid gloves. It is a black metal record, after all. But there is no glorification of the crimes. We treat the subject as a dark fairytale. It is fascinating and his story has bewitched many other people. There are at least 15 pieces of work written on him by historians who are as fascinated as we are. We just put it to a soundtrack.&quot; <br /><strong><br />Cradle of Filth</strong> chose to create a another concept album after their stint on 2007&rsquo;s Viva la Bands tour. Dani recalls, &quot;We were fired up and we had the skeletal structures to five or six songs. I knew I wanted to outdo our previous efforts. We had a new drummer and the music we were writing was coming from the excitement of the live setting, which can give you that emotion. The feeling of the music reminded me of when we did Cruelty and the Beast, which was 10 years prior. I was pouring through all the notebooks I had kept from investigations I had done into Elizabeth Bathory, who was the conceptual figure of Cruelty, and Gilles de Rais&rsquo; name cropped up back then. I remember thinking that story would be great to follow up our first concept album, only ten years later, since we didn&rsquo;t want to do two concept albums back to back.&quot;<br /><br />In honour of the tenth anniversary of their first concept album, Dani and his bandmates were more than inspired to revisit that aesthetic territory, which had served them well in the past.  &quot;The music had that same magic as when we were writing Cruelty, and it was very symphonic, as well,&quot; the singer says. &quot;The more I started reading, the more I realised that this story is better than Elizabeth Bathory&rsquo;s. Gilles was such a well-known man in a more well known part of the world. Elizabeth was Eastern European and not a lot of information survived her. With Gilles, we have the trial transcripts of the man who was essentially the bodyguard of Joan of Arc. He was Grand Marshal of France, for God&rsquo;s sake. The more I read, the more the story germinated.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> have long been interested in the occult, as individuals and as a band and that&rsquo;s why the story of de Rais was so appealing a person to set to a soundtrack, Dani explains, saying,  &quot;The fundamental basis of what we do is turning things into dark fairy tales and romanticising them. Every single line of the album is a part of the story. It&rsquo;s not like we have footage of his dungeons, so we are filling in gaps. Some scholars believe he was framed. He was a man of war in a brutal time. I don&rsquot think we could ever embellish the nasty parts to the extent of reality.&quot; In a sense, <strong><em>Godspeed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder</em></strong> is like fan fiction of sorts. <strong>Cradle of Filth </strong>draw their fans and listeners into a story, something that has endeared the band over the years, making the band a &quot;lifestyle&quot; for their dedicated followers. Dani says, &quot;With this record, you can immerse yourself in stories I&rsquo;ve written and the music the band has written and you can also go and investigate and find out more for yourself by reading about the case.&quot; <br /><br />In a way, <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> studies de Rais because &quot;he was a man of extremes who ended up at the gates of hell,&quot; finishes Dani. &quot;He was in love with the whole enigma of Joan of Arc and when she was captured and burned, he saw she was like everyone else and he felt betrayed. Since they had saved France against the English, he got close to God, as close as anyone could at the time. When that was gone, he fell from grace and went the complete opposite way. He was excommunicated and never got into heaven, which back then was the worst thing that could ever happen. He was a marriage of extremes.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> are a marriage of extremes as well, taking a controversial character in history and fusing his story with thunderous, scarred &rsquo;n charred metal on <strong><em>Godpseed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder</em></strong>. <br /><br />', 2004, NULL),

(69, 'Cynic', '                             <p><strong>Cynic</strong> was formed in November of 1987 in Miami, Florida by Paul Masvidal and Sean Reinert . Paul and Sean were elementary school classmates when they first started making music together. After a series of mini-projects and explorations, they decided to seriously seek out other musicians. For junior high, Paul was sent away to boarding school in upstate New York where he found bass player Mark Van Erp. Mark eventually moved to Miami along with his friend Jack Kelly who was added on vocals thus completing the first official Cynic line-up. This early incarnation of <strong>Cynic</strong> was focused on making brutal death metal with primary influences taken from bands such as Venom, Possessed, Slayer, Kreator, Destruction and Dark Angel. It is this lineup that would later be featured on the release of their first, self-titled demo in 1988.</p><p><strong>Cynic</strong> parted ways with Jack in 1988, and Paul took over vocal duties. Jason Gobel (whom they met at a show they performed at) was added on guitar and and in 1989, they cut their second demo, entitled <em>Reflections Of A Dying World</em>, consisting of four songs. All of the songs on this demo were of the speed metal/thrash genre, with even some punk elements incorporated. This lineup soon began touring the south Florida area and bootlegs exist of them as far back as May of 1988. Soon after, Mark was out of the band and Tony Choy was added on bass. In 1990, <strong>Cynic</strong> released their third demo (also self-titled). This helped to gain them a large following throughout southern and central Florida, as well as their constant touring and cameo appearances (opening for national acts) in the South Florida area. This new lineup would remain intact until 1991.</p><p>During this time, the bands&#39 influences were beginning to dramatically change. While they were still listening to contemporaries like Atheist and <strong>Death</strong>, and enticed by the sheer intensity of these extreme forms of music, their musical and creative abilities were growing, and consequently, they began listening to more complex and eclectic forms of music. Classic jazz, bebop and fusion groups such as Mahavishnu Orchestra and Allan Holdsworth began influencing their work. Artists such as Pat Metheny and Frank Zappa, 20th Century classical music and even certain forms of pop were expanding their record collections. This change in technical and creative skill had already made its way into their songs as the band took a great leap forward in musicianship for their second and third demos.</p><p>By the early part of 1991, <strong>Cynic</strong> had evolved into a progressive death metal band, although the band themselves didn&#39t consider themselves to be death metal. The music had the technicality of progressive metal with the brutal vocal qualities of death metal. They cut a fourth and final demo in 1991 (financed by <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>) consisting of three tracks. Two of these tracks would, in a drastically different form, make it onto their debut album. In April of 1991, Paul and Sean played on the groundbreaking <strong>Death</strong> album <em>Human</em> alongside the band&#39s mastermind Chuck Schuldiner and Steve DiGiorgio of Sadus. They described their relationship with Chuck as &quotvery laid-back&quot, and were able to help Chuck with the writing by giving him input, which had been missing on the earlier <strong>Death</strong> records. The result was a classic record, and <strong>Death</strong> even got some MTV airplay for their video &quotLack Of Comprehension&quot. At the same time, Tony Choy was filling in for the late Roger Patterson on Atheist&#39s <em>Unquestionable Presence</em>, also a great album in its own right, and guesting on Pestilence&#39s <em>Testimony of the Ancients</em>. Paul did guitars on Master&#39s <em>On The Eighth Day, God Created Master</em>, and Jason worked with Monstrosity (whom Mark Van Erp joined), playing lead on their <em>Imperial Doom</em> album. All of this guest work helped to enlarge the fan base for <strong>Cynic</strong>, making them, according to <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>, &quot...the most popular underground act to never record an album.&quot</p><p><strong>Cynic</strong> was planning to record their first full-length album on the <strong>Roadrunner</strong> label after recording the<strong> Death</strong> record, but Paul and Sean decided to complete the tour cycle for <strong>Death</strong>&#39s European tour through the rest of 1991. These and other delays were part of what expanded <strong>Cynic</strong>&#39s popularity and also gave them more time to develop their sound. Immediately upon Sean and Paul&#39s return from <strong>Death</strong>&#39s European tour, they scheduled to go into the studio in October of 1992 with Scott Burns to record their debut album , when catastrophe hit. Unfortunately for everyone, Hurricane Andrew destroyed Jason&#39s house along with the band&#39s rehearsal facilities. Their plans to record were put on hold until March of 1993. Incidentally, this also interrupted Chuck Schuldiner&#39s plans for the next Death release, <em>Individual Thought Patterns</em>, for which Sean Reinert was his first choice as drummer. Sean decided to put his energies back into <strong>Cynic</strong>. Chuck hired ex-Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan (whom he met through writer / long-time associate Borivoj Krgin) to fill in. During this time, <strong>Cynic</strong> was working with ex-Viogression vocalist Brian DeNeffe. Also around this time, a track of Cynic&#39s was finally released on CD. &quotUroboric Forms&quot appeared in demo form on the <strong>Roadrunner</strong> compilation <em>At Death&#39s Door II</em> in 1992 with a note that <strong>Cynic</strong>&#39s debut album would be released in May 1993.</p><p>May 1993 came and went and no album appeared. The band mutually parted ways with Tony Choy who went on to become Atheist&#39s full time bass player. Soon after, Chris Kringel joined the band, whom they met through Brian Deneffe (Viogression). Chris played with the band for a while (and eventually with Portal), but logistics and stylistic differences led to Darren Mcfarland (from Atheist) whom went into the studio with the band. When things didn&#39t work out with Darren, <strong>Cynic</strong> were back in Miami with all tracks recorded minus bass. Days after their return, Steve Digorgio was at Morrisound recording <strong>Death</strong>&#39s <em>Individual Thought Patterns</em>. One day in a phone conversation with Paul, Steve passed the phone to Sean Malone who happened to be an employee at Morrisound. Steve learned of his bass playing skills during the <em>Individual</em> recording sessions. After sending his bass demo to <strong>Cynic</strong> and meeting shortly after, he recorded bass tracks at Morrisound Studios (where the band had recorded their previous demos), and they finally mixed the record. September 14, 1993, <em>Focus</em> was finally released. With over two years since their last demo,<em> Focus</em> was a remarkable change from the style of any of their previous material, and quite different from anything else in the music world as well.</p><p>After the release of<em> Focus</em>, <strong>Cynic</strong> went on a European tour supporting <strong>Pestilence</strong>. For their live shows, they added a fifth member, lead singer/growler Tony Teegarden, who had actually sung the death vocals on<em> Focus</em>, (since Paul was in danger of losing his voice at the time). Note: Paul sang the ethereal computer voice for all the live shows. Tony also played keyboards live. Due to his schoolwork, Sean Malone could not tour with the band so Chris Kringel came back and replaced him. The tour was cut short, however, when <strong>Pestilence</strong> disbanded. Returning to the states in January 1994, <strong>Cynic</strong> did a few shows in the Florida area, playing the states for the first time in over two years. Malone&#39s only European appearance with <strong>Cynic</strong> was at their Dynamo Festival appearance in the summer of 1994. Next, <strong>Cynic</strong> toured the States during the summer of 1994 supporting Cannibal Corpse. Their tour stretched over 3 months and covered most of the United States. Malone rejoined the group for this tour. Tony was unable to participate, so they borrowed Dana Cosley (from local Florida band Demonomacy) to do the death vocals and the keyboards. Tony did rejoin the group for a show in West Palm Beach which was the only show to contain all the original<em> Focus</em> members.</p><p>After the tour, <strong>Cynic</strong> began work on a new album. In the early stages of working on their upcoming album, the band parted ways with Sean Malone. Soon after they reunited with bassist Chris Kringel who moved back to Miami and worked with the band to write and record the Portal demos. Sean Malone&#39s split with the band was amicable, however, and has continued to work with Sean R., Paul and Jason to this day. Part of the musical shifts at this time, were the band&#39s decision to add a female vocalist. Aruna Abrams was found through a letter she wrote to the band while a student at Berkeley College of Music. After the band received her audition tape, she was asked to join Cynic. She moved to Miami and worked closely with the band for a year writing and recording what would eventually transform into Portal. Sometime during the fall of 1994, while working on the new album, <strong>Cynic</strong> shifted. New directions and sounds led to a name change. <strong>Cynic</strong> was complete and finished it&#39s work under that name. The band felt urged to rebirth into a new musical concept that was born out of these changes. Portal was born.</p><p>-Compiled by Brian Meloon &amp Jeff Litvak from various sources<br />-Updated by Jeff Litvak &amp Tim Spear</p>', 2004, NULL),
(70, 'Daath', '                             <p>Extreme metal with a purpose, <strong>Daath</strong> is poised to emerge as one of the most exciting new bands of 2007 with its <strong>Roadrunner</strong> debut, <em><strong>The Hinderers</strong></em>. Fusing elements of death, thrash, and black metal with technical virtuosity and a decidedly Atlanta groove, the 13 songs comprising <em><strong>The Hinderers</strong></em> showcase the crushing power of this Georgia six-piece.</p><p><strong>Daath</strong> is a Hebrew word meaning knowledge, referring to a knowledge not regularly attained by the masses. Says keyboardist and conceptualist Mike Kameron, &quotOn a mental level, <strong>Daath</strong> acts as a doorway between instinct and intellect, and in our opinion the struggle between those two aspects of mind is what causes most of the ills in the world.&quot </p><p><strong>Daath</strong> is atypical of extreme metal bands, not just making heavy music to make heavy music. There is a purpose beyond the headbanging. &quotBasically,&quot says guitarist Eyal Levi,&quotWe&#39re exploring the inverted tree of life. It&#39s a Kabalistic concept. There are thirteen points on the tree and each one of the songs is representative of the points. Mike will research the attributes for each one of those points and then we figure out what the theme is and write the lyrics based on that. The music is lots of back and forth... we&#39re not one of those bands that gets together and jams. I&#39ll write, Mike will write and then we&#39ll get together and try to make things happen, but it&#39s definitely a team effort. Everyone has to like what we&#39re doing or we don&#39t do it.&quot<br /><br />Mike adds, &quotThe theme of the album is the sum of all self-defeating views which keep us from rising above the norm. We&#39re all dealing with it and we all have things we&#39ve gotta get through in our lives, which are completely internal in order to improve and move on. We&#39ve all gone through it in this band and this represents where we&#39re at. But we&#39re definitely not a religious band or anything like that - it&#39s about exploration. It&#39s an ongoing process. A struggle. Mainly we&#39re just using the tree of life as a framework for psychological exploration and exploring esoteric themes associated with the tree of life.&quot</p><p>Eyal describes the band&#39s unique sound as versatile. &quotWe all have a lot of influences. I started playing the violin when I was four, and I listened to everything from Gustav Mahler to The Doors to Aphex Twin. I don&#39t think that we&#39re traditional death metal. I would say that we&#39re progressive extreme music. We draw from various styles of extreme music - death, black, doom, whatever... we throw in electronica, we throw in orchestral, we throw in some classic rock. We&#39re definitely not sticking to death metal. We&#39re not limiting it. We&#39re always trying to grow, and we already decided which aspects of our sound we want to emphasize more. Our goal is to add new elements with each record, and hopefully we&#39ll always be doing something that people like.&quot</p><p>The band is pushing the boundaries of traditional death metal. There is a lot of groove to the songs on <strong><em>The Hinderers</em></strong>, notably on &quotSubterfuge,&quot &quotFrom The Blind&quot and &quotOvum.&quot &quotThat&#39s probably just because we&#39re from Atlanta, you know?&quot Eyal laughs. &quotI think that&#39s got a lot to do with it. We like music that grooves, and I think one of the main problems with extreme metal is that there&#39s no real groove to it. That is what keeps it from going to wider audiences. For example, with &#39Subterfuge&#39 I specifically wanted that song to be &#39Atlanta death metal&#39 to bring a crushingly heavy groove that would make people&#39s heads nod, but to also incorporate some very ethereal parts and then a bad-ass solo!&quot </p><p><strong>Daath</strong> was started by Eyal Levi, Mike Kameron and Sean Farber, who have been playing in bands since they were in high school. The three friends attended school at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston. Eventually, the guys left school to concentrate full-time on making music as the project which would become <strong>DAATH</strong> proved far too promising. </p><p><strong><em>The Hinderers</em></strong> was produced by James Murphy (<strong>Disincarnate</strong> ex-<strong>Death</strong>, Testament, <strong>Obituary</strong>) and co-produced by <strong>Daath</strong>. James and Eyal engineered the record with the help of Andy Sneap, while Colin Richardson mixed the album for them. Eyal says on working with the pair, &quotColin and Andy are two dudes that I wanted to work with at some point in time in my music career... taken care of on this album. It just goes without saying what an excellent experience this has been.&quot</p>', 2007, NULL),

People were feeling it, &quot; There&rsquo;s a unity when we play live,&quot; says Brandon, &quot;we just go at it and make sure everyone has a good time.&quot; They quickly started gathering a strong following, but unlike some bands, you couldn&rsquo;t put your finger on your &rsquo;average&rsquo; Dislocated Styles fan. &quot;It&rsquo;s bizarre how we draw people in,&quot; says Chuck. &quot;We bring in people that you wouldn&rsquo;t expect to listen to our brand of music.&quot; <br><br>As Dislocated Styles&rsquo; touring circle grew and they started to invade California, the band took the stage with the likes of Incubus, Jimmie&rsquo;s Chicken Shack, Snot, Papa Roach, and Hed (P.E.). One of the biggest moments was when the band was asked to play The Edgefest in Phoenix in front of 15,000 people. The still-unsigned local faves shared a bill with Kid Rock, Primus, and Powerman 5000. &quot;When we all walked out there, we all just looked at each other. It was a really good moment,&quot; remembers Chuck. &quot;The crowd was so loud and they were awesome. We blew it up! I remember being so nervous before we went on and then I just said &rsquo;Fuck it. Whatever.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not going to see this as anything different from any other gig we&rsquo;ve ever done.&quot;<br><br>Dislocated Styles also found time to put out an EP, Spanking The Funky and a full-length entitled Elevator Music. The Band peddled both records at their shows, but if you&rsquo;d like to score yourself a copy you&rsquo;d better check eBay since both records are long gone.  Soon enough, the major labels came sniffing around. &quot;It was really strange,&quot; says Chuck, &quot;because we never thought it would blow up like it did. We were doing it for fun and then it turned into something we could do for real.&quot; Though many wanted the boys to sign on the dotted line, the band was most impressed by the typically heavy-minded Roadrunner Records  &quot;We have always gone by feeling,&quot; said Chuck. &quot;A lot of other labels approached us, but none of them were as good as Roadrunner. They were so real. I say &rsquo;Whatever feels the best,&rsquo; and Roadrunner felt the best by far.&quot; By the end of 1999 the Southwestern collective had a deal and were set to record what would become Pin The Tail On The Honkey.<br><br>The final piece to the puzzle was producer Howard Benson (P.O.D., Zebrahead) and his partner-in-crime, engineer Bobby Brooks. In May 2000 the band locked themselves in the studio for six weeks in Sherman Oaks, California with the duo to put their mayhem on tape. Benson kept the vibe loose and free flowing. &quot;He brought a lot of stuff out of us - stuff we didn&rsquo;t know we had,&quot; states Chuck. &quot;It was so fun, he was such a good motivator.&quot; <br><br>Most of the album had already been written by the time the console board lit up, but a trio of tracks did get flushed out in the booth, including what would be the anthemic first single, &quot;Liquefied.&quot; Hip-hop rhythms and a phat bass bounce swerve amidst a driving guitar riff as Jason Dubree (turntables) raps &quot;I&rsquo;m falling and I can&rsquo;t get up/And I tried to walk, but almost threw up/Only took a few shots, but I didn&rsquo;t last/This time Mr. Cuervo got the last laugh.&quot;  &quot;I think everyone can relate,&quot; says Brandon. &quot;Liquefied&quot; is pretty straight forward,&quot; agrees Chuck, &quot;It&rsquo;s a common ground I think we all have.&quot; The shout-out sing-along chorus urges &quot;Raise up your cup and drink up/It&rsquo;s as simple as that/In the club give me love/&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;ll give it right back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fire in the Hole&quot; is a blistering vitriol &rsquo;n&rsquo; venom-filled rant about hardcore relationships gone horribly wrong. Brandon spits out the chorus with a particular vehemence, &quot;Turn the heat up/We be getting&rsquo; down, till the ashes hit the ground.&quot; &quot;It&rsquo;s about one of those horribly fucked-up relationships that we&rsquo;ve all had,&quot; says Brandon. On the other end of the emotional spectrum, the bouncy pop vibe of &quot;Clocks&quot; celebrates all things green and bluntable. &quot;You have to have a good time, you have to release,&quot; insists Chuck. &quot;The way we release some of our negative energy and stress is by having a good time.&quot; <br><br>Pin The Tail On The Honkey is one of those records that defies categorization, but undeniably surfs the zeitgeist taking in a flurry of influences and spitting them out in a completely new form. Dislocated Styles are set to rip your head off and stick it on backwards with their particular variety of audio chaos.<br><br><br>', 2001, NULL);

(78, 'Doubledrive', '                             In an age dominated by angry, loud rock and tales of woe and abuse, it is refreshing to see a band break from the doldrums that bind their peers and revel in the pure redemptive power of rock n&rsquo; roll.  DoubleDrive&rsquo;s music is not based on false attitude and ego-driven bluster, rather it is substance unto itself – possessing a sense of both edginess and melody.  Their debut for Roadrunner Records, <u>Blue In The Face</u>, is a bold statement to that effect. “We&rsquo;ve been holding our breath so long waiting for this to happen,” says doubleDrive guitarist Troy McLawhorn, explaining the album&rsquo;s title. Vocalist/guitarist Donnie Hamby believes <u>Blue in the Face</u> accurately sums up the last three years of the band&rsquo;s life. “It&rsquo;s almost like a rite of passage,” he explains. “It covers the ups and the downs, the sweet and the sour and the whole journey that it took to get here. It was a big learning process – you&rsquo;ve got to put a value on sacrifice – but it really paid off.” Bassist Josh Sattler agrees. “Everything happens for a reason, and we&rsquo;re in a much better place now, so it&rsquo;s worth the wait,” he says. “This whole time, we&rsquo;ve been in search of a situation that would put us on the road and let us play for people. To us, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.” As for doubleDrive&rsquo;s own moniker, it could very well refer to the group&rsquo;s relentless determination to see the album released. While the Atlanta quartet was highly visible throughout 1999 and 2000, when the band toured with artists as diverse as Kid Rock, Stereo Mud and Sevendust, doubleDrive has spent much of the last two years under the radar.  <br><br>But doubleDrive wasn&rsquo;t ready to ride off into the sunset just yet. Unhappy with its former record label (which released the group&rsquo;s first album, <u>1000 Yard Stare</u>), doubleDrive returned to Atlanta determined to do things differently the second time around. In 2001, the band recorded 14 songs with producer John Philip Kurzweg (Creed and Puddle of Mud), piquing the interest of Roadrunner in the process. Soon after, a contract was signed, and the group returned to the studio in mid-2002 for a blitzkrieg 10-day session.<br><br>This time, doubleDrive teamed with famed producer/mixer Michael Barbiero, whose resume reads like a history of contemporary rock. (Three words: <u>Appetite for Destruction</u>.) With Barbiero, the band recorded four new tracks, along with revised renditions of two songs from the Kurzweg sessions Barbiero then remixed five additional tracks that the group originally recorded with Kurzweg. The end result, <u>Blue in the Face</u>, showcases organic, straightforward and bare bones rock sensibilities underscored with a modern edge. “It&rsquo;s not brain surgery - it&rsquo;s just rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll,” drummer Mike Froedge says. “We like to do everything pretty old-school, meaning we don&rsquo;t like to do a lot of editing and splicing. We figure, just push the red button and play.”<br><br>Yet while the music flowed freely, the album&rsquo;s lyrical content is founded in quite the opposite, largely based upon the band&rsquo;s frustration with being delayed in bringing its music to the people. One notable exception is first single “Imprint,” which Hamby co-wrote with a longtime friend of the band who was diagnosed with terminal cancer. While the rest of the group was overseeing the mixing process, Hamby took a day off to fly across the country to visit him.  The two had often discussed writing a song together. “The next morning, an hour before I had to leave, I grabbed a pen and a piece of paper, and we just started writing out some of the things he said the night before.”  Hamby continued working on the song after returning home, but he soon heard that his friend had passed away. “It didn&rsquo;t hit me, because I was deep in the writing and it was like I was having this moment with him,” he says. “It was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever experienced before.”  The end result is a song that lures the listener with tender lyrics of hope and redemption.  Upon its completion, the band knew “Imprint” needed to be included on <u>Blue in the Face</u>. Although Hamby says he&rsquo;s proud of the song and believes it “has a great message,” doubleDrive usually prefers to let the music do the talking. “We don&rsquo;t like to over-explain the lyrics, or even try to explain them at all,” Froedge says. “It doesn&rsquo;t matter what it means to us - it matters what it means to the listener. Whatever the subject of the song may be, we just try to convey the emotion, feeling and message in the way we perform it.”<br><br>The band initially recorded an electric version of another track, “Big Shove,” but the acoustic rendition featured on <u>Blue in the Face</u> made the final cut “just for the vibe of it,” Hamby explains.  While the original version of the song rocked with a pompous swagger, the album version tones down the testosterone and injects a hearty dose of raw emotion.<br><br>Even in the studio, though, the stage is never far from anyone&rsquo;s mind. “We try to make the song the best song it can be,” Froedge says, “and then we think, &rsquo;Is this going to be fun to play live?&rsquo;” McLawhorn believes that feeling stems from the fact that the four members of doubleDrive have performed together – first as MK Ultra – for more than six years now, while he and Hamby have been jamming since they were teenagers. “We grew up onstage, and I think what made us love music was the live performance part of it,” he says. <br><br>Hamby believes <u>Blue in the Face</u> proves that doubleDrive has evolved, but that, in effect, the song remains the same. “What hasn&rsquo;t changed is our love for what we do,” he says. “We love to play music. It keeps you going it pumps you up and no matter how tired you are, you want to go do it again.”<br>', 2003, NULL),
(79, 'Downer', '                             &quot;We called ourselves Downer - maybe we jinxed ourselves from the get-go,&quot; says guitarist and co-founder Aaron Silberman. The Orange County based four-piece&rsquo;s Roadrunner debut is an eleven song tangle of emotion and gigantic riffmongery huge rock ambitions infused with hardcore intensity.  From the appropriately-titled introductory burn of &quot;Flex&quot; to the last gasp of &quot;Curbed&quot;, Downer is a non-stop groove down a melodic and darkened drain.<br><br>&quot;We get our work ethic from growing up in the Orange County hardcore/straight edge scene,&quot; say vocalist John Scott.  It&rsquo;s always been a grassroots/do it yourself thing.  I find that relying on someone else usually results in being let down.&quot;  That feeling is core to the longstanding partnership between<br>Silberman and Scott, both veterans of the late 80&rsquo;s, early 90&rsquo;s Orange County Hardcore scene - Scott with Headfirst and Silberman with Mission Impossible. Both spent their musical adolescence side by side with bands like Inside Out (who gave the world Rage Against the Machine frontman Zach De La Rocha) and The Offspring. &quot;Our first gig as Downer was with The Offspring in a pizza parlor in Norco in front of about four people!&quot; Aaron laughs. &quot;Our second show was at the Whiskey with Korn opening for us!&quot; It never seemed the right time - til now, Downer struggled through the morass of trend and time, with two independent releases, a self-titled five song EP and a 1997 album, &quot;Wrestling With Jesus&quot;, both on the tiny Ammunition label.<br><br>With influences ranging between U2, Jane&rsquo;s Addiction and Fugazi, Downer had to prove themselves regardless of who they played in front of.  1996 found the band traversing America with metal-core warlords, Earth Crisis. The following year Downer ripped it up in front of an Arizona Lollapalooza crowd. &quot;Both of those experiences were amazing,&quot; states Scott.  &quot;They pushed us to be fierce. Our heads were shaved. We were playing music that didn&rsquo;t fit in and kids were getting into it.  That&rsquo;s what makes this so worth it for us..&quot; And that sheer will to overcome even the most indifferent crowd is what seems to drive Downer. &quot;We could have walked away from this so many times,&quot; says the singer. &quot;We can&rsquo;t.&quot;<br><br>Many bass players, drummers and gigs later, cut to producer Bob Marlette&rsquo;s (Black Sabbath, Sinistar, Tony Iommi)  home studio during December 1999. With drummer Tracey Sledge , in tow, the &rsquo;record&rsquo; button was pressed and Downer was delivering. Having struggled over the past few months writing the record, once production was in full swing, the results were staggering. &quot;It took us maybe two weeks to get it down,&quot; states the frontman. &quot;No wasted time. Working with Bob was awesome. He got performances out of all of us we never would have thought we were capable of.&quot;  The end of recording saw the entrance of Jed Hathaway, originally a guitar player that stepped over to bass to join the Downer fold.<br><br>True to its name, Downer isn&rsquo;t exactly an easy or exceedingly pleasant trip.  Take the disturbing cover artwork by cult hero and Metallica scribbler, Pushead as a warning, then go full-throttle with the energetic pound of the<br>first single &quot;Last Time&quot;. Soaring and infectious from the first note, it&rsquo;s a high-energy bludgeon imbued with what Aaron sums up as &quot;the reality of the situation.&quot; For frontman John Scott, Downer&rsquo;s lyrical viewpoint isn&rsquo;t anything but &quot;...total honesty. What we all face in our lives. They may not be the happiest things...but I&rsquo;m probably not the happiest person. (&quot;Last Time&quot;] is about how you&rsquo;re so sick and tired of letting people down, you&rsquo;re ready to climb up to the roof and end the dissapointment permanently.&quot; <br><br>The singer pauses for a moment. &quot;It&rsquo;s about getting by day by day and not letting things keep you down. All that stuff comes and goes. Money woes. Job stress. Disappointment. Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get through it.&quot;   So when you&rsquo;re on the ledge, looking down - &quot;Jump!&quot; the frontman laughs, correcting himself. &quot;No, fight, get through it.&quot;<br><br>Downer: eleven songs of frustration, desperation and salvation.

(80, 'Dry Kill Logic', '                             It isn&rsquo;t often that a band like Dry Kill Logic comes along - a band whose musical depth exceeds its anger. That is not to say that the music lacks attitude, in fact it is downright pissed off, but with a focus that is not often heard in heavy music today.  Singer  Cliff Rigano, guitarist Scott Thompson, bassist Dave Kowatch and drummer Phil Arcuri deftly combine their uniquely-styled rage, tension and talent into an explosive mixture that separates them from others in their genre. <br><br>Originally formed in Westchester, New York in 1995, Dry Kill Logic took their cue from the proverbial gods of metal -- Pantera, Tool, King Diamond, Sepultura and Fear Factory. In 1997 they released their first EP &rsquo;Cause Moshing Is Good Fun&rsquo; on their own Psychodrama Records. &quot;Psychodrama is everywhere,&quot; Cliff explains. &quot;I&rsquo;ve always felt that the forces of stupidity surround the human race constantly. Everything has to be a really big deal these days. People aren&rsquo;t willing to let go of even the smallest thing.&quot;  After wracking up some prime opening slots for the likes of Exodus, Flotsam & Jetsam, and Pro-Pain, the band went into the studio in July &rsquo;98 with producer Andy Katz (Overkill, Local H, Rakim) to cut a full length effort, &rsquo;Elemental Evil&rsquo;. Quickly hailed by their peers as a force to be reckoned with, they were invited to share the stage with Coal Chamber, Incubus, Anthrax, System of a Down, and the Misfits, just to name a few. &quot;When we get on stage it&rsquo;s such a ferocious, violent show,&quot; Cliff states.  Despite the local successes, internal tensions in the band were running high and when their then-guitarist split, Dry Kill Logic decided to spend 1999 taking some time off and strategizing their next move. This was not to be the end of Dry Kill Logic, it was merely the calm before the storm.<br><br>After this much needed break, Dry Kill Logic regrouped with a vengeance. In their search to fill the vacant guitar slot, the band met Scott Thompson, who was working as a piercer at a tattoo shop at the time, through a mutual friend and hit it off straight away. &quot;You can spend years writing with people and never get anywhere,&quot; Cliff admits. &quot;Then you can spend minutes with the right person and get ten times as much accomplished. Hinge was taken to a new level once Scott joined.&quot; Phil couldn&rsquo;t agree more &quot;Scott was a blessing in disguise. We all instantly clicked and he fit right in.&quot; The newly forged foursome started writing for the new record in February of 2000 and went into the studio with Scrap 60 Productions (Eddie Wohl, Steve Regina and Rob Caggiano) in August. With the fire in them burning strong, they quickly tracked the 13 anything-but-quiet tunes that were to become The Darker Side of Nonsense. Talking about the session, Phil is still ecstatic &quot;It was off the wall. We all knew what we were trying to do and everyone was on the same page. The vibe was great.&quot;<br><br>The intensity and fury on every track on The Darker Side of Nonsense is almost palpable from the churning guitars to the pummeling rhythm section, every track is a catharsis of sorts. &quot;The funny thing is that the songs aren&rsquo;t about anything in particular. I don&rsquo;t write them with an issue or a person in mind,&quot; Cliff explains, &quot;I like for people to get out of them what they will. It&rsquo;s not that they are anger for anger&rsquo;s sake - they are very much a part of me.&quot;  &quot;The new stuff shows we&rsquo;re fed up with everything,&quot; Phil states. &quot;We wanted it to be straight-up just heavier and more in-your-face.&quot;  From the opening assault of &quot;Nightmare&quot;, with its screaming chorus of &quot;Me + You = Nightmare&quot; to the all out aural pummeling of &quot;Pain&quot; to the more melodic yet equally deadly &quot;Feel the Break,&quot; The Darker Side of Nonsense is sure to put Dry Kill Logic atop the pantheon of heavy music.<br> <br>Dry Kill Logic is a beast of its own one that claws at you and gets under your skin and into your head the way that few bands do.

(81, 'Earth Crisis', '                             Confrontation. Activism. Militant viewpoints put to music. That&rsquo;s Earth Crisis.  &quot;Our revolution is real, it&rsquo;s radical,&quot; states vocalist Karl Buechner. &quot;There&rsquo;s no empty sloganeering.&quot;. It&rsquo;s a militancy that&rsquo;s made Earth Crisis both controversial and misunderstood insightful and inciting. Their Roadrunner debut, Breed the Killers takes that scorched-earth policy to another level. <br><br>There&rsquo;s an intelligent calm that belies Karl&rsquo;s philosophical rage. &quot;I want to boil it down to one notion: personal accountability,&quot; says the softspoken Buechner in a voice far removed from his trademark apocalyptic roar. &quot;Respect for yourself, respect for the lives of innocent beings around us.&quot; True, the name Earth Crisis has become synonymous with a  &quot;Straight-Edge&quot; doctrine free of drugs - including alcohol and  meat  the agenda goes much deeper. &quot;Just being drug-free doesn&rsquo;t make you a good person,&quot; says Karl. &quot;You need to use that clarity of the mind to become actively involved in the struggle that is being waged for earth, human and animal liberation.&quot; <br><br>Formed in Syracuse, NY, Earth Crisis began its march in 1992 with the release of their All Out War EP on the tiny Conviction label. Signing with the Chicago-based Victory Records led to a collection of &rsquo;manifestos&rsquo; from the city-leveling call-to-arms of 93&rsquo;s Firestorm EP to 1994&rsquo;s likewise incendiary Destroy the Machines full-length. The millennial shriek of 1996&rsquo;s, Gommorah&rsquo;s Season Ends --  which Terrorizer magazine hailed as: &quot;Heavy hardcore taken to a new level, all the blackness that was hinted at on &rsquo;Firestorm&rsquo; realized in all its formidable glory.&rsquo; - pushed the band to new heights with its steely combination of technical chops and bilious ferocity.&quot;  Breed the Killers shows the Earth Crisis revolution growing: in terms of sound and ideas.<br><br>&quot;On Breed the Killers I think we achieved the most honest representation of our sound without sounding too raw or too slick,&quot; says drummer Dennis Merrick.  The tones, textures and unexpected melodies that seep out of the guitars, came through the presence of British producer Andy Sneap (Machine Head, Stuck Mojo).   &quot;I think Andy was afraid we were going to push our views on him,&quot; recalls Merrick. &quot;From start to finish it was a great experience.&quot; The newfound groove, flow and surprising left-turns of tracks like the anti-racism title-track barb or &quot;Overseers&quot; had a lot to do with the synergy between Sneap and the individual band members who hit the studio with great enthusiasm.  &quot;Being able to have Ian and Scott in the same room while we were tracking was great. It was more of a challenge to get it right the first time. It was just a lot less clinical, like we were onstage, going for it, just like playing a show.&quot;  <br><br>&quot;Lyrically, we&rsquo;re still on the frontlines.&quot; insists Karl. &quot;It&rsquo;s the last shock-force before Armageddon.&quot;  From the eerie soundscape of &quot;End Begins&quot; with its broken-glass-fractals of doom: &quot;As a new millenium begins/Once faint hoof beats become clearer&quot;, the message is darker and more foreboding than anything Earth Crisis has posed to date.  Even a cameo from friend and fan, Machine Head frontman Robb Flynn rings with that very apocalyptic rage: &quot;Adapt to the harshness...Or become one with the dust!&quot;   &quot;A huge part of our mission has been to forward what in truth has been suppressed information,&quot; states Karl. &quot;About what&rsquo;s happening to animals in fur farms, in vivesectionist laboratories. How these gargantuan companies don&rsquo;t view this as anything but numbers, how tracts of rainforest or areas of the Pacific Northwest are nothing but areas on a map. There&rsquo;s blood on their hands.&quot; <br><br> &quot;The ship is, in truth, sinking.&quot; says Karl of Breed the Killers&rsquo; charged lyrical perspective. &quot;But we can save some of the passengers.&quot; In the same manner as the peace-punk bands that influenced them early on or latter day insurrectionists like Sepultura or Rage Against the Machine, Earth Crisis&rsquo; lyrical perspective is pure &quot;die-on-your-feet-rather-than-live-on-your-knees&quot;. Example: Direct Actions taken by environmentalist groups including the Sea Shepards and Earth First! eco-terrorists celebrated with the anthem, &quot;Ultramilitance&quot;. &quot;People like Ron Coranado who damaged and sunk whaling ships in Iceland burnt down a fur research facility, these are people fighting to keep bio-diversity alive on this planet,&quot; says Karl. &quot;These people are literally saving lives, they are causing damage to these profit-minded corporations. These are the people who realize that their house is on fire.&quot;  <br><br>Earth Crisis have fanned the flame of their revolution to firestorm-like proportions. Their outspoken stance has been displayed in the media CNN, MTV and various network news outlets have devoted airtime to the band. &quot;It signs that the movement and our ideology is growing and is being recognized as a positive thing, it&rsquo;s gratifying,&quot; says Karl. On a musical front, the band&rsquo;s horizons blossomed in 1996 when they played the innaugural Ozz-Fest date in San Bernadino, CA with Ozzy and Slayer  amongst others.  &quot;It was one of the most incredible shows I&rsquo;ve ever seen!&quot; Buechner enthuses. &quot; It was the first time we were there for someone else&rsquo;s audience and they totally accepted us,&quot;.  While Earth Crisis made a name for themselves as a metallic prime-mover for the hardcore sect, it&rsquo;s been that exposure to other crowds through an appearance on the Ozz-Fest album and video compilation as well as gigging with the likes of Downset and Vision of Disorder that has set the stage for Breed the Killers.   <br><br>&quot;I want this to be the record that takes us to the next level, to people who haven&rsquo;t already heard us,&quot; says the frontman. &quot;I want to get the music and message out there: to people who haven&rsquo;t heard these conspiracy theories, to people who haven&rsquo;t heard about Earth First! or the ALF.&quot; Buechner pauses for a second, summing up Earth Crisis in a caustic nutshell. &quot;We&rsquo;re five people that have committed to making the world a more peaceful place, starting on a personal level.&quot;<br><br>Earth Crisis realize the end is near.

(82, 'Exhorder', '                             <strong>Exhorder</strong> was a thrash metal and then groove metal band formed in New Orleans, USA during the late 1980s. They are often credited as the purveyors of the groove-oriented thrash sound later made famous by bands such as Pantera, <strong>Machine Head</strong>, and White Zombie. <p>It has been claimed that <strong>Exhorder</strong> more or less invented the sort of angry, 90&#39s post-thrash metal often attributed to Pantera. It&#39s not really clear who was first (and ultimately it may not matter much), but the resemblance between <em>The Law</em> and Pantera&#39s <em>Cowboys From Hell</em> is clear, with stripped-down rhythm guitars, heavy double-bass drumming, and angry, almost identical vocals complimenting the basic American thrash style of the late 80&#39s. One thing to remember is that <strong>Exhorder</strong>&#39s <em>Get Rude</em> demo, of 1986, has some songs which was released too in their debut <em>Slaughter In The Vatican</em>, making believe that they made their sound before Pantera (because at the same time, Pantera was in their Hair Metal times). After two albums the band broke up, and vocalist Kyle Thomas went on to form Floodgate, and also briefly appeared live as the vocalist for Trouble. As late as 2002 Thomas indicated a desire to put out a new <strong>Exhorder</strong> album, but that doesn&#39t appear to be happening at this time, as he is now devoting time to his new band, Pitts vs Preps.</p><p><strong>Exhorder</strong> released two albums in the early 1990s, <em>Slaughter in the Vatican</em> and <em>The Law</em>.

(83, 'Fear Factory', '                             <strong>Fear Factory</strong> may have recently passed on into heavy metal history following their latest album <em>Digimortal</em>, but the band&#39s legacy lives on not only in their catalog, which includes the gold-certified <em>Obsolete</em>, but in the forthcoming release of their never-before heard album <em>Concrete</em>, produced by heavy music guru Ross Robinson. <br /><br />On July 30th (2002), fans of the Southern California metal band will take a journey back to a time when the quartet was just beginning to develop its cutting-edge, death metal-meets-industrial sound. (And when drummer Raymond Herrera was still in high school!) Amazingly, the long-lost <em>Concrete</em> has never been leaked out in bootleg form or proliferated on the Internet, so it is a genuine surprise release.<br /><br />&quotI&#39m very happy about it coming out,&quot beams <strong>Fear Factory </strong>co-founder and guitarist Dino Cazares.&quot It&#39s something special for the kids, who never even heard it. They can see where we were coming from. Back then, we were gigging in East L.A. We didn&#39t really have too much recording under our belts. We had recorded a couple of demos before that, but we had never worked with a producer like Ross Robinson.&quot<br /><br />Recorded in 1991, barely a year after Fear Factory formed, <em>Concrete</em> is important for several reasons. Firstly, it established the band as a viable player in the metal world. While ultimately the group did not want to sign with Robinson&#39s label, <strong>Fear Factory </strong>would use the 16-track release as a way to secure a deal with Roadrunner Records. Producer Ross Robinson, who later sold the album to Roadrunner, would use it as a calling card to produce future stars like Korn and Limp Bizkit. The album also offers a history lesson for people. Vocalist Burton C. Bell brought a melodious style to the death metal world, and influences such as Godflesh and Ministry would propel the band into the industrial and techno realms without losing their core audience.<br /><br />&quotAt the time [of Concrete], all these death metal bands were coming out, and a lot of people were afraid to cross those boundaries,&quot recalls Cazares. &quot<strong>Fear Factory </strong>was a band about taking chances. Not all those chances worked,&amprdquo but at least they pushed the envelope as much as they could. While Fear Factory delved into technological realms, they were not able to do so right from the start. &quotAt the time, we didn&#39t have money to experiment with that,&quot remarks Cazares, but he confirms that the intentions were already there, and they began manifesting themselves on the 1993 release <em>Fear Is The Mindkiller</em>.<br /><br />&quotMe and Ross bumped heads a couple of times on the whole digital thing,&quot recalls Herrera of the <em>Concrete</em> sessions. &ampldquoAs you know by now, Ross isn&#39t very up into the high-tech production stuff. He likes the raw analog stuff, which is cool. I ended up not getting my way [then], but I did later,&amprdquo he remarks with a laugh. Adds Cazares: &quotHonestly, I think <em>Concrete</em> sounded better than <em>Soul Of A New Machine</em>. Ross is really good at capturing the moment.&quot<br /><br />Metal aficionados may find it amusing to learn that <em>Concrete</em> was recorded at Blackie Lawless&#39 studio, where Robinson was then employed as an engineer. &quotIt looked like a cowboy ranch,&quot says Cazares. &quotEverything was all wood. There were cowboy hats, guns, skulls, and cow heads. It was cool.&quot While the band officially recorded drums and vocals during the day, close friends Cazares and Robinson snuck in at night to record guitar and bass tracks, which explains why Dino says the $5,000 album has a $10,000 sound. &quotMaybe someday we can pay back Blackie Lawless,&quot he says with a laugh. &quotI&#39d like to thank him very much for letting us record there! We borrowed some of Blackie&#39s bass equipment to record the bass, without him knowing it. And now he will. Blackie, if you&#39re listening, I&#39m sorry!&quot<br /><br />Eight of <em>Concrete</em>&#39s sixteen tracks were re-recorded for the band&#39s official 1992 <strong>Roadrunner</strong> Records debut <em>Soul Of A New Machine</em>. Four more have never been heard before: &quotSangre De Ninos,&quot &quotDeception,&quot &quotAnxiety,&quot and &quotUlceration&quot. Other songs are presented in their original forms before they mutated into, or became a part of, other songs. &quotConcrete&quot transformed into &quotConcreto&quot as a bonus track on 1998&#39s <em>Obsolete</em>, &quotSoulwomb&quot became &quotSoulwound&quot for that same release, while the instrumental &quotEchoes Of Innocence&quot metamorphosed into &quotA Therapy For Pain&quot for 1995&#39s <em>Demanufacture</em>. Then there is &quotPiss Christ,&quot an entirely different song than the one heard on <em>Demanufacture</em>.<br /><br />Herrera notes of the four unreleased songs that &quotwe never even went back and tried to fix or update them.&quot They represent early, raw <strong>Fear Factory</strong>, pre-sampling and pre-keyboards. &quotThere wasn&#39t a huge budget to do it,&amprdquo the drummer says of the album. &quotWe were all beginners.&quot But he makes no apologies. &quotIt is what it is.&quot<br /><br />Quite simply, Concrete represents the genesis of one of SoCal&#39s biggest metal groups. &quotIt shows where the band came from,&quot affirms Herrera. &quotThis CD is the roots of <strong>Fear Factory</strong>.&quot', 1993, NULL),
(84, 'Five Pointe O', '                             There&rsquo;s a certain amount of integrity that goes with calling your first record <u>Untitled</u>. Not irony, as with some debut discs titled some variation of Greatest Hits, but confidence, poise. And Joliet, IL sextet Five Pointe 0 (&quot;Five&quot;, represents the fifth element of the earth: everything that comes from within the human mind and soul., &quot;Pointe&quot;, gives the fifth element a sense of direction and destination., and &quot;O&quot;, the absence of everything.) has integrity as well as musical chops in abundance. And <u>Untitled</u>, as it refers to their full-length debut for Roadrunner Records, means they know they&rsquo;ve brought the certified ingredients to the table, and titles are merely window dressing.<br><br>Over its 54-minute duration, which commences with a reality shattering, &quot;chik-chik-kaPOW!&quot; on &quot;Double X Minus,&quot; Untitled evinces a band fluent in such rock dialects as double-bass thrash, grindcore, and hardcore and they meld them together with hints of melody and startling fluidity. It&rsquo;s a convergence and Five Pointe 0 has nailed it their first time out, not to mention before most of the members have hit legal drinking age. It&rsquo;s as frightening as it is thrilling - and ironic, for as bad a rap as heavy music gets nowadays, the very young&rsquo;uns at the center of the complaint are churning out some of the best heavy rock around. <br><br>&quot;The way we work,&quot; says guitarist Sharon Grzelinski &quot;is we forget that everything around us exists and just go from our initial feeling, which is just what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on around us, not what&rsquo;s sellin&rsquo; records.&quot;<br><br>The band formed in late 1998, when vocalist Daniel Struble and bassist Sean Pavey, fresh out of an unsatisfactory musical endeavor, started jamming with Sharon, just for something to do. It was instant alchemy. &quot;We just got this crazy feeling for it,&quot; says Sharon, &quot;and we decided we needed to expand on it.” <br><br>They found drummer Tony Starcevich in another band, Chamber. He was willing to split time between bands, until settling on Five Pointe O as his full-time gig. Says Daniel, &quot;It used to be [Tony] bringing his drums back and forth from our practice to his other practice, then he just left &rsquo;em with us [laughs].”<br><br>Keyboardist Casey Mejia and guitarist Eric Wood, as it happens, are Daniel&rsquo;s cousins and fit perfectly into the mix. Casey&rsquo;s keyboards would add an industrial element, as well as melodic sophistication to offset the ferocious combination of Sharon&rsquo;s and Eric&rsquo;s riffing (as well as the latter&rsquo;s guttural backing vocals) and Tony and Sean&rsquo;s military-precise rhythmic offensive. With Daniel&rsquo;s supple vocals that range from soaring and melodic to a sepulchral bark front and center, it&rsquo;s a magnificent metallic din. Again, frightening and thrilling even more so when one considers another dimension to Five Pointe O: lyrical substance.<br><br>Daniel&rsquo;s astute lyrics belie his 18 years, as he dips into such spiritual wells as Buddhism and Shamanism for insight and guidance, but without settling on a particular doctrine or deity. &quot;I look into everything,&quot; he says. &quot;I&rsquo;m not Christian by any means at all. Personally, I don&rsquo;t find a problem with people believing in God or whatever, but I don&rsquo;t believe in worshipping anything. I&rsquo;m always looking into things that are about bettering yourself instead of hoping or asking for forgiveness. Bettering yourself while you&rsquo;re here, alive, in this lifetime…I&rsquo;m into that. I like things that have evidence.&quot;  <br><br>Produced by Colin Richardson (Fear Factory, Machine Head, Napalm Death, Cannibal Corpse) at Sonic Ranch Studios in Tornillo, Texas, the record&rsquo;s eleven tracks devastate. From the opening shot, &quot;Double X Minus&quot; to the Armageddon analysis &quot;Purity 01,&quot; with its tribal drum intro and intense, chugging riffage, Five Pointe O confront the listener with their aggressive aural agenda. Tracks like the bleak post-9/11 statement &quot;Freedom” and &quot;The Infinity&quot;, a song that lyrically addresses Daniel&rsquo;s quest for betterment accompanied by a background of apocalyptic rhythms and heavy guitar riffing, highlight both the lyrical depth and musical breadth of the Chicago sextet. Untitled, unearths emotions that many wish to leave buried deep within their hearts, but Five Pointe O are fully prepared to tap into that wellspring of negative energy unleashing their passion and turning a negative into a positive.', 2002, NULL),

Augmented first by Michael Balch and later, more significantly, by Rhys Fulber, the bands innovative mixture of industrial rhythms, electronics and guitars, together with stunningly hiâ€‘tech and futuristic videos, forged a sound that many bands in the electronic world are only just starting to pick up on. <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>MONUMENT</span></em> takes a peek at Front Line Assembly&rsquos most productive period (from 1989 to 1993), and is edited together by band producer and most important coâ€‘collaborator Greg Reely to include several exclusive remixes.</p><br><p>F.L.A. first became a major force on the burgeoning hardcore techno/EBM music scene with the release of 1989&rsquo;s <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>Gashed Senses and Crossfire</span></em>.&nbsp This record was a sparse and menacing album that spawned the club hits &lsquo<em>Digital Tension Dementia</em>&rsquo and &lsquo<em>No Limit</em>&rsquo (both included here) which proceeded to rule dancefloors everywhere. Initially the bands distinctively European disposition led them to become more successful in Europe than in their homeland and left journalists falling over themselves to acclaim the band&rsquos Sonic Cathedral sound.</p><br><p>However, nothing could prepare the unsuspecting listener for what was to follow â€‘the uncompromising and visceral <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>Caustic Grip.</span></em>&nbsp Following Balch&rsquos departure Rhys Fulber became a full time member of the band.&nbsp Dense and imposing, the unholy triumvirate of singles taken from this period - &lsquo<em>Iceolate</em>&rsquo, &lsquo<em>Provision</em>&rsquo and &lsquo<em>Virus</em>&rsquo, pushed aggressive Euro-friendly industrial techno to the forefront. They are the musical equivalent of being hit over the head with a billy club.</p><br><p>1991&rsquo;s <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>Tactical Neural Implant</span></em> saw&nbsp a move away from the harsh sonic battery of <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>Caustic Grip</span> </em>to more melodic song structures and hummable choruses, while retaining its predecessor&rsquos dark and aggressive qualities. By this time Front Line&rsquos cybernetic vision was in full throttle, reflected in the singles taken from the album.&nbsp The anthemic <em>&lsquoMindphaser&rsquo</em>, perhaps FLA&rsquos biggest hit, was released in March 1992 and won several awards for its amazing Manga influenced video.&nbsp As a follow up, <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>The Blade</span></em> was heavily remixed and appears here in a Proâ€‘Gress mix by renowned Manchester producer Mark Stagg.</p><br><p>Also featured is the &lsquo<em>Mindphaser</em>&rsquo B side &lsquo<em>Toxic</em>&rsquo, originally recorded as the title track of a mini album follow up to <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>Caustic Grip</span></em> that was later shelved for being too sonically demanding. &lsquo<em>Heatwave</em>&rsquo and &lsquo<em>Target</em>&rsquo were recorded during the <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>Tactical </span></em>sessions but left off the ensuing album.&nbsp Finally the tracks saw the light of day as additional tracks on the European release of <em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>The Blade</span></em>.</p><br><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot;>Millennium</span></em>, released in 1993, marked a shift away from the band&rsquos traditional European sound to a harsher hybrid of metal and electronics which opened up a large audience for the band in the US and proved the band were unafraid to experiment and take on new ideas. From this period is taken <em>&lsquoSurface Patterns&rsquo</em>, appearing here remixed for the first time.&nbsp In 1997 F.L.A.&rsquos legacy is assured, although the focus of the band has changed again following Fulber&rsquos departure last year.

Check 1982&rsquo;s infamous <u>This Is Boston: Not L.A.</u>  compilation (Modern Method) for proof.  Songs like &quot;Snob&quot; or &quot;Liar&quot; were lacerating bursts of teen-testes overloaded with adrenaline and angst. You think you know THRASH? You don&rsquo;t know shit, jack. Gang Green - then comprised of guitarist/screamer Chris Doherty, bassist Bill Manly and future US Marine/drummer Mike Dean - wrote the book. And in the burst of energy that so typified the early hardcore scene, these Southern, Mass speedsters split up - live fast, split up young, leave a lot of  Mohicaned dumbfucks dumbfounded and lookin&rsquo; for more high-velocity kicks.<br><br>Doherty spent the next couple years toiling with Mass hardcore heavies Jerry&rsquo;s Kids, as well as early ska-corists. The Cheapskates - basically, the Bosstones Mach 1 with Dickie Barrett on vocals!  Come 1984, prompted by Taang! Records guru Curtis, the threesome pulled it back together for the infamous &quot;Alcohol&quot;/&quot;Another Wasted Night&quot; 7&quot;. &quot;Alcohol&quot; was the proverbial dumbass anthem that still sounds just as vital today. Hessian overlords, Metallica even covered the song! With The Brothers Stilfen: Chuck and Glen on guitar and bass, respectively, as well as ex-Jerry&rsquo;s Kids skinsman Brian Betzger. Gang Green were back on the map and touring the states in a haze of frayed chords, great rock riffs and their  trademark spray of Budweiser. And in their wake the T-SHIRT - the Budweiser logo replaced with the words GANG GREEN: KING OF BANDS! If any of you out there have that infamous bit of couture, please forward a photo of yourself in it! <br><br>Yes, they drank. And drank.  And skateboarded...And drank.  Gang Green&rsquo;s beverage du-jour? Budweiser - &quot;No doubt about it, can&rsquo;t live without it!&quot;  became the Gang Green call-to-arms and with the Bud label, their coat of arms. Da Green ruled the Boston area under that red and white flag. Their hometown popularity swelled to mammoth proportions, the band winning local radio station, WBCN&rsquo;s  1987 &quot;Rock N Roll Rumble&quot; and  a coveted opening slot for none other than Ozzy Osbourne in New Hampshire in the hot Summer of that year. That era of the band is best documented on 1987&rsquo;s Taang! LP Another Wasted Night (which featured their infamous cover of Til Tuesday&rsquo;s &quot;Voices Carry&quot; -- titled &quot;Voices Scarey&quot;!) A few line-up changes - future Bosstones founder Joe Gittleman coming in on bass and guitarist Fritz Erickson picking up guitar chores, Gang Green inked with Roadrunner imprint Emergo.<br><br>It was inevitable. Gang Green had begun to trade pure speed for pure rock. Their subsequent, and cheekily titled, Roadrunner/Emergo output&rsquo;s <u>Older Budweiser</u>, <u>King of Bands</u> and the brilliantly titled <u>I81B4U</u> (their riff on the classic  Van Halen title) - all collected on 1991&rsquo;s King of Bands compilation - saw a brilliant fusion of  rock n roll deering do and frat-house hi-jinks. There were the inevitable line-up changes - DRI bassman Josh Pappe doing a stint with Doherty and crew as they kicked up a storm of dust and a haze of brew in their travels. <br><br>Where are they now? Chris Doherty did momentarily resurface with punk resurgence hangers-on Klover in 1993. Basically, that was a short-lived affair engineered by former Gang Green manager Alec Peters, then an A&R type at Mercury. Suffice to say, that went nowhere fast.  A CD entitled <u>Another Case of Brewtality</u> surfaced on Taang! a couple years back. From time to time, Gang Green - still fronted by Doherty, last seen running a Sacramento, Ca. rehearsal space where noiseniks, Will Haven practice - poke out their heads to kick out the jams and have a few brews. No doubt about it, Gang Green carved out their place as the fastest and probably drunkest in the land.', 2003, NULL),
(88, 'Glassjaw', '                             Naked and truthful. Pure and brutally direct. Glassjaw work stray chords, a Radiohead-ish swirl of guitar and a  barrage of  bared emotions into a frenzy that&rsquo;s singular and uncompromising. Glassjaw&rsquo;s IAM/Roadrunner debut, Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence   is as riveting and personal a record as you could ask for. One where beauty turns to disgust where melodies turn molten. <br><br>From the start, the members of Glassjaw didn&rsquo;t know or care about anything other than playing together. Vocalist Daryl Palumbo and guitarist Justin Beck may have been 14 or 15 at the time they started making this glorious racket in their Long Island parents&rsquo; basements. &quot;We&rsquo;ve always kind of done whatever we want.&quot; says Beck, now 20.. &quot;We always knew that we&rsquo;d go get a lot further doing something on our terms rather than what everyone else was doing around us,&quot; Palumbo, also 20, chimes in. &quot;We were always too dorky looking to be metal kids...and we looked like skaters. Nobody knew what to think of us!&quot; At that point, who played what instrument wasn&rsquo;t even the issue, Beck serving as the band&rsquo;s occasional bassist and on-and-off drummer. What was important was making music without confine. To Glassjaw, sticking out like a sore thumb made more sense than blending into the pack. <br><br>One person whose ear Glassjaw managed to catch was producer Ross Robinson who calls the band &quot;The new post-millennial destroyers of Adidas rock, R.I.P.&quot; Known for his work with Korn and Limp Bizkit, as well as his IAM label imprint through Roadrunner (already home to the likes of Slipknot), Robinson heard a mere few seconds of the band at first on a crudely recorded demo a few days later at rehearsal and the IAM/Roadrunner deal was sealed. &quot;Ross showed up at a practice,&quot; Beck recounts. &quot;We start a song 5-4-3-2-1. Ross stands up, waving his hands and he&rsquo;s like, &rsquo;It&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s done. I want to do this, you&rsquo;ve got  a deal!&rsquo; he told us. It was chills from the start. We couldn&rsquo;t believe it...and actually didn&rsquo;t believe it for weeks.&quot; <br><br>The ensuing two months of recording at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, CA were focused and intense. &quot;The first day of preproduction, we had no idea what to expect,&quot; says Beck. &quot;We start the first song and Ross is yelling &rsquo;Stop! Stop! He says to Daryl, &rsquo;What&rsquo;s this song about?&rsquo; Daryl starts telling him and we start giggling a bit. He stopped us dead in our tracks and basically let us know that this wasn&rsquo;t a joke at all. It was dead serious. It put us all in check. He made Daryl spell out exactly what the song was about which was extremely personal. He taught us that the more you hold back, the more you cheat yourself and the more you cheat everyone else.&quot; <br><br>That honesty is core to Glassjaw. From the gnashing guitars of &quot;Pretty Lush&quot; the plunging bass-lines of &quot;One Eight Becomes Two Zeros&quot; the gnarled pop of &quot;Ry Ry&rsquo;s Song&quot; straight to the musical and emotional meltdown of &quot;Motel of the White Locust&quot;, Glassjaw&rsquo;s debut speaks volumes. It&rsquo;s as delicate and sensitive as it is venomous. Palumbo&rsquo;s lyrical point of view is one of utter brutality and a keen intelligence &quot;Punk times fifty!&quot; he exclaims cribbing bits and pieces from sources as diverse as Elvis Costello, the Bad Brains, Squeeze and Japanese Anime and monster flicks. &quot;Collage is the art form of the 20th century!&quot; he states emphatically.  For instance: &quot;Godzilla is a metaphor for life,&quot; he states with a smile. &quot;Every song I write is originally named after something relating to a Godzilla movie. Don&rsquo;t laugh! Godzilla movies singlehandedly taught me about growing up taught me about relationships, respect. If you get f**ked, you have to level Tokyo!&quot;<br><br>Expect moments as gnarled and powerful as the title track, a cascade of pure sound and emotion that culminates in Palumbo screaming &quot;THIS IS WHAT IT&rsquo;S LIKE TO BE ALONE!!!!!&quot; A wired howl from a frontman who&rsquo;s spent the past few years dealing with the intestinal disorder, Crohn&rsquo;s Disease. &quot;I&rsquo;m not exactly the most positive person in the world, but it&rsquo;s important for me to share this experience with people,&quot; the frontman believes. &quot;I know what I wish I could have heard when I was diagnosed with this incredibly serious disease. I know what it feels like to be alone in a hospital room. I&rsquo;m just a f**kin&rsquo; 20 year old dork, but if I can make people feel less alone, that&rsquo;s important.&quot;  <br><br>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence  isn&rsquo;t necessarily an easy listen it is, however, as truthful as a 20 year old can be.  &quot;This record is basically a modern take on love,&quot; the frontman explains. &quot;You can write a record that&rsquo;s an anti-relationship record or a broken heart record or a revenge record. Fact is, I&rsquo;m in plain English saying what&rsquo;s on my mind as bluntly as possible. Sorry, real life isn&rsquo;t politically correct. This is how I feel in my heart and my guts. If you say you can&rsquo;t relate to this, then you haven&rsquo;t had your heart broken.&quot;<br><br><br>Glassjaw: naked and painful. Beautiful and honest.

However, <em>The Erosion Of Sanity</em> failed to make an impact in the midst of the black metal explosion of 1993 and band and label parted ways. <strong>Gorguts</strong> then fell silent for five years, and many fans assumed that they had parted ways permanently, but singer Lemay returned in 1998 with a new line-up (guitarist Steeve Hurdle, bass player Steve Cloutier and drummer Patrick Robert), a new contract with the Olympic label and Obscura, which lived up to its title by exploring progressive, almost avant garde areas to an uncertain response. <em>From Wisdom To Hate</em>, featuring new guitarist Daniel Mongrain, was similarly difficult, but <strong>Gorguts</strong> are nothing if not persevering.</p><p>(Gorguts.com)</p>', 1991, NULL),

(91, 'Hatebreed', '                             Let&#39s say <em>Revolver</em> and <em>Alternative Press</em> Magazines called the record you were making one of their Most Anticipated of 2006 as you were in the midst of switching labels. Perhaps you also had a world tour mapped out before and after recording, including a run on the 2006 Ozzfest main stage, with just enough time built in to fly your vocalist home to tape episodes of the TV show he hosts - MTV2&#39s HEADBANGERS BALL. Throughout all this, you ran your various business ventures (an indie record label, clothing company, tattoo shop, managing real estate investments and much more) from cell phones wherever you were and called in news updates to various websites that cover your band and the scene to which you have dedicated a great portion of your life. With all this, you might very well be burnt out after 10 years in the spotlight. Jamey Jasta, Sean Martin, Chris Beattie and Matt Byrne - also known as <strong>Hatebreed</strong> with brand new member Frank Novinec - do it all, with a singular focus and hard-earned credibility only dreamt of by many of their contemporaries. <br /><br />&quotI wanted to get in the right head space, to get back to square one, and to why I started expressing myself through music in the first place,&quot says frontman Jamey Jasta about <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, his band&#39s fourth full-length and Roadrunner Records debut. &quotOnce [bassist] Chris [Beattie] and [guitarist] Sean [Martin] started bringing ideas to the table, and I started arranging songs and reading through the lyrics I had compiled, I got excited again. I wanted to feed off that and the feelings that I had on our first record. I wanted to tap into those good feelings and adrenaline and to express and communicate them over the most intense album we&#39ve ever made.&quot Thanks to the visceral, fierce music contained on <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, it appears that the members of <strong>Hatebreed</strong> , who were nominated for a Grammy in 2005, have gotten their &quotinspiration&quot back. <br /><br />On <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, <strong>Hatebreed</strong>, who&#39ve toured with everyone from Slayer to new labelmates<strong> Slipknot</strong>, deftly illustrate all the things that have made them one of the underground heavy metal scene&#39s most beloved and most important bands of the past decade. It also presents a new and improved <strong>Hatebreed</strong>, who took some time, celebrated their ten-year anniversary with a sold-out tour, reconnected with their fans, navigated some personal issues, and then recorded an album that is as hulking as it is tight, as tough as it positive. This Connecticut quintet - rounded out by drummer Matt Byrne and new second guitarist Frank Novinec - is ready to show the world why its throne atop the heavy metal kingdom with <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>is firmly intact. While a &#39positive&#39 <strong>Hatebreed</strong> might seem like a contradiction in terms, since they play aggressive music that sets off carnage-producing moshpits, Jasta pens lyrics that speak of hope, rising above, and believing in yourself. It is precisely those qualities that will allow <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>to connect with the kids on a profound level.<br /><br />&quotYou can&#39t have one without the other,&quot Jasta says about the band&#39s dichotomy of neck-snapping music paired with uplifting lyrics. &quotThat&#39s our niche. It&#39s what we&#39ve done from the beginning.&quot He also says &quotwe wanted to expand on it, without veering too far from what we&#39ve built,&quot when it came to crafting <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>. Jasta admits that he was in a bit of personal slump over the past two years, and that he considered leaving the music business. He was able to break the negative cycle, thanks to two essential things: his redirected focus and his fans. &quotI was becoming disenchanted with the music business, touring and other aspects of being in a band,&quot he admits. He thought long and hard about <strong>Hatebreed</strong>&#39s future, and when it came time to sit down and write <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, he and the boys played with ideas demoing in different studios. <br /><br />The ease and comfort of the process sparked <strong>Hatebreed</strong>&#39s creativity, and as a result, <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong> combines the raw, intense bite of their debut, <strong><em>Satisfaction Is The Death Of Desire</em></strong>, with the tectonic-plate-shifting power of <strong><em>Perseverance</em></strong>, resulting in their best effort to date. Jasta continues, &quotIt was important to show on this record that it&#39s not how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up. I wanted to reconnect with positive energy, and convey that through the music. I wanted to stay on our path, but make it better, more concise, and turn any nonbelievers into believers.&quot<br /><br />Jasta also contends that the main theme on <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>, which was produced and mixed by Zeuss at Planet Z in Massachusetts, is overcoming &quotfeelings of depression, guilt, sadness, anxiety, alienation. I wanted to show that there is hope, and you have to start with yourself. You can&#39t help other people if you can&#39t help yourself.&quot Sonically, the band thickens its sound with the addition of Novinec, and <strong>Hatebreed</strong> plays with speeds, textures and explores new vocal terrain on <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong>. &quotWe did slow stuff, fast stuff, more double bass,&quot Jasta explains. &quotWe wanted to accentuate the drive, the intensity, and make certain parts heavier. But we also wanted to make sure the message came through.&quot Here, Jasta enters some different vocal registers, previously unheard on <strong>Hatebreed</strong> records although you wont hear any clean guitar or vocal harmonies that&#39s for sure.<br /><br /><strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong> contains the cathartic, cleansing &quotDestroy Everything&quot and the anthemic &quotDefeatist,&quot the chorus of which the <strong>Hatebreed</strong> faithful will scream at the top of their lungs at shows. About that song, Jasta says, &quotIt&#39s like me talking to myself, and talking to people that I don&#39t want to be like. It&#39s about not defeating your purpose or giving into assumptions and doubts. That&#39s something that I never sang about.&quot The thoroughly cathartic &quotTo The Threshold&quot was the focus track on Headbanger&#39s Ball: The Revenge, while the call-to-arms &quotNever Let It Die&quot and &quotHorrors Of Self&quot are songs where Jasta mined his personal life for source material. &quotI started chipping away, changing things I knew weren&#39t working for me,&quot Jasta says, referring to the turnaround that he experienced. &quotI had to mend relationships, cut other relationships off, and get back to why I wanted to be in a band. I had to reignite the spark, so to speak, because I was burnt out.&quot After logging 600 shows in a mere two years, the frontman turned the negative into a positive. &quotI started reading emails, letters, and reopened my PO box which was shut down due to the volume of mail I received,&quot Jasta reveals with candor. &quotI reconnected with fans on our 10-year anniversary tour and talked to the kids, and met with so many people who were motivated and inspired by our words, our songs, and had overcome worse problems than I ever had, so it made me appreciate the power of music again.&quot <br /><br /><strong>Hatebreed</strong>&#39s fans gave back to the band, just like the band gave itself to the fans, showing the redemptive, cyclical power of their music. Ultimately, <strong><em>Supremacy</em></strong> is a testament to renewal and reconnecting. It is also the defining statement of one of metal&#39s most important, most &quotsupreme&quot bands.', 2006, NULL),

With their explosive percussive elements and Spanish-guitar undertones, the band lent a much-needed &#39worldly&#39 element to their aggressive rock assault. From the get-go, <strong>Ill Nino </strong>was something new, something different - their first single from <em>Revolution, Revolucion</em>, &quotWhat Comes Around,&quot was added early at K-ROCK New York, and with a video directed by Marcos Siega, the band was off and running. Now there is <em>Confession</em>, the next logical step in the band&#39s burgeoning career. Once <em>Confession</em> hits the streets, there will be no looking back for <strong>Ill Nino</strong>, as they have struck an artful balance between memorable and menacing.<br /><br />In the past two years <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s debut has exceeded 350,000 units worldwide in sales and the band has enjoyed highly successful stints on both the US and European 2002 Ozzfests, the 2002 Jagermeister Tour as well as touring with the likes of P.O.D., Drowning Pool and Static X. But it wasn&#39t all smooth sailing, as the New Jersey group weathered some rather intense storms, including some member changes. Whereas lesser bands might have had a hard time with the adjustment, <strong>Ill Nino </strong>is a better band because of it, with their unique chemistry fully in tact.<br /><br />Ultimately, through <em>Confession</em>, the real <strong>Ill Nino </strong>emerges. The heavily, percussive album is fuelled by the band&#39s patented tropical percussion, soaring riffs, alternate English and Spanish language lyrics, and an appreciation for melody. Regarding its telling, open title, singer Cristian Machado says, the album is &quotabout coming clean with your thoughts, your past experiences, and within yourself. It&#39s about telling the truth, not only to others, but also to yourself.&quot<br /><br />By their own admission, <em>Confession</em> takes <strong>Ill Nino </strong>to the next level. After spending two years on the road in support of <em>Revolution, Revolucion</em>, the band was exhausted, yet extremely motivated, to dive into the writing and recording processes for <em>Confession</em>. The band immediately started writing their new record in January 2003, hit the studio in April, and wrapped up in July, with barely any time off in between their last 2002 tour date and the recording process. It&#39s clear that dedication to its craft is one of <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s strongest qualities. <br /><br />&quotBeing on the road for two years helped the band gel musically and as friends,&quot says <em>Confession</em> co-producer Chavarri. &quotWe were ready to come up with a brand new record that would take us to a new level.&quot Machado finishes, &quotThis is definitely a more defined <strong>Ill Nino </strong>sound.&quot The band is extremely confident that <em>Confession</em> will appeal to all audiences, including heavy metal headbangers and rock radio fans. Machado explains, &quotThe record is heavy and is everything <strong>Ill Nino </strong>fans want to hear.&quot<br /><br />It&#39s also got everything a non <strong>Ill Nino </strong>fan would want to hear in a band: attitude, emotion, and aggression. Not every rock band out there can lay such a claim, but one listen to &quotHow Can I Live&quot deftly illustrates <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s ability to stretch itself across many rock genres without ever spreading itself too thin. <br /><br />During pre-production for <em>Confession</em>, <strong>Ill Nino </strong>parted ways with two members, but was blessed to hook up with former <strong>Machine Head</strong> guitarist Ahrue Luster, who was a friend of the band, to fill the vacant guitar spot, and Danny Couto, who jammed with guitarist Jardel Paisante in his pre-<strong>Ill Nino </strong>days, to fill the percussionist slot. But this departure had an even greater positive effect for both bassist Laz Pina and guitarist Jardel Paisante as it allowed them to grow and expand their position as the backbone of <strong>Ill Nino</strong>. While it might seem frightening to incorporate new members into the band on the eve of a new album, Chavarri admits that the new members &quotbring a new fire, new energy to the band in every aspect. They are the perfect fit for <strong>Ill Nino</strong>.&quot<br /><br /><em>Confession</em> was produced by Bob Marlette (Saliva, Black Sabbath) and is &quoteverything we want it to be, musically and spiritually,&quot reveals Chavarri. The ferocious first single, &quotHow Can I Live,&quot which was also the lead single from the <em>Freddy Vs. Jason</em> soundtrack, burrows its fangs into your memory with its unforgettable melody. &quotTe Amo, I Hate You,&quot says Machado, &quotis about bipolar personalities in everyday life. Sometimes you don&#39t always have the answers and the best decision is no decision. Life always balances itself out somehow.&quot The tense &quotLifeless Life&quot is <strong>Ill Nino</strong>&#39s song about that safe refuge place in life that everyone has where they can run to get away from things bringing them down.<br /><br />With <em>Confession</em>, <strong>Ill Nino </strong>are baring all for their fans. It is a telling and open musical statement from a band that is not afraid to expand the boundaries &ndash both sonically and geographically &ndash of heavy music. The band plans to bring their unique &quotRevolution&quot to even further corners of the world this time around. With an album as fine as <em>Confession</em>, that shouldn&#39t be a problem.', 2001, NULL),
(94, 'Jerry Cantrell', '                             From the lyrically and sonically mournful “Psychotic Break” to when the mental and musical exorcism of Jerry Cantrell&rsquo;s nearly 73-minute aural <u>Degradation Trip</u> concludes with the lovely, somnolent, bluesy strains of “Gone,” the singer/guitarist&rsquo;s Roadrunner debut is a sundry and sometimes scary journey to the center of a psyche. It may not always be a pretty trip, but it&rsquo;s a close-to-the-bone excursion that haunts both its creator and its listeners. <br><br>As the multi-faceted artist relates, “In &rsquo;98, I locked myself in my house, went out of my mind and wrote 25 songs,” says the then-fully-bearded Cantrell. “I rarely bathed during that period of writing, I sent out for food, I didn&rsquo;t really venture out of my house in three or four months. It was a hell of an experience. The album is an overview of birth to now. That&rsquo;s all,” he grins, though the visceral and haunting songs, by turns soaring and raw, do reflect that often-naked and sometimes-grim truth. “<u>Boggy Depot</u> [his 1998 solo bow] is like Kindergarten compared to this,” he furthers. “The massive sonic growth from <u>Boggy Depot</u> to <u>Degradation Trip</u> is comparable to the difference between our work in the Alice In Chains albums <u>Facelift</u> to <u>Dirt</u>, which was also a tremendous leap.”<br><br>And all of Cantrell&rsquo;s 25 prolifically penned songs will see the light of day by 2003. <u>Degradation Trip</u>, which will be released June 18, is comprised of 14 songs from the personal, transcendent writing marathon that inspired such self-searching cuts as “Bargain Basement Howard Hughes,” “Hellbound,” and “Profalse Idol.” The second batch of songs—“as sad and brutal as <u>Degradation Trip</u>” —Cantrell promises, are due out on Roadrunner 2003. Given Cantrell&rsquo;s introspective, on-the-edge mindset, it&rsquo;s no surprise then, that the melodic, ultra-heavy riff rocker “Anger Rising,” is <u>Degradation Trip</u>&rsquo;s first single and video. Or those songs like “Mother&rsquo;s Spinning in Her Grave (Glass Dick Jones)” and “Solitude,” (which contains the lyrics which gives the album its title) are pointed, pained and forceful. Yet there&rsquo;s the softer side to the often wry and sarcastic singer/songwriter/guitarist, evinced by Cantrell in the romantic “She Was My Girl,” and the unforgettable chorus of the wistful “Angel Eyes.”  A more countrified vibe runs through the acoustic-influenced toe-tapper “Give It A Name,” which also boasts beautiful, angelic vocals.  <br><br>Though Cantrell prefers to remain mum on how autobiographical any of his songs might be, it&rsquo;s clear that the writer of such Alice In Chains hits as “Rooster,” “Them Bones,” and “Would?” certainly composes whereof he knows, and his pain and experience bleeds through on <u>Degradation Trip</u>. The literate, visual lyrics match the edgy, soaring and layered musicality, provided on the disc by bassist Robert Trujillo (Suicidal Tendencies, Ozzy Osbourne) and drummer Mike Bordin (Faith No More, Ozzy Osbourne), who may tour with Cantrell when not otherwise occupied with Osbourne, with another guitarist also added to that mix. <br><br>Cantrell&rsquo;s current touring band consists of members from Atlanta lineup Comes With the Fall, friends and former tour openers. While ex-Queensryche guitarist Chris DeGarmo plays on “Anger Rising,” and Cantrell himself can be found onstage guesting with bands and friends ranging from Stone Temple Pilots to labelmates Nickelback to Metallica, Cantrell preferred to buck the trend of making <u>Degradation Trip</u> a guest-heavy all-star album.<br><br>With a wildly successful show at the 2002 SXSW conference in Austin giving a preview of what&rsquo;s to come, it will certainly be a joy for Cantrell to have the dark musings on <u>Degradation Trip</u> see the light of day on tour. Given its purging power, the CD should have provided its creator with catharsis shortly after its completion. <br><br>But Cantrell&rsquo;s emotional liberation is just coming with the CD&rsquo;s 2002 release. “&rsquo;Psychotic Break&rsquo; is a great place to start the album, because that&rsquo;s where I was at the time,” relates Cantrell of the last few years before and during <u>Degradation Trip</u>&rsquo;s completion at several Los Angeles-area studios, including the legendary A&M, with co-producer/engineer/mixer Jeff Tomei. “Writing these songs, I was about ready to lose my mind. It&rsquo;s a lot for any person to exist in this business anyway....” Cantrell begins. “But I was writing this record to be released by my former label, and we didn&rsquo;t see eye to eye in the middle of the process. They pulled the funding, and I mortgaged my house to continue on. And I produced it myself to boot. It was a tough time to have it go on, but I was focused fully on making a record. I didn&rsquo;t even have a manager at the time. It&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t want to do again, but I&rsquo;m proud I did it and it all worked out.” <br><br>What Cantrell needed, and found in Roadrunner, was “a company with balls enough to deal with me and my music. There&rsquo;s a lot of milque-toast crap that is really successful. It was such a massive project - 25 songs, two discs, for my debut on a new label. Roadrunner, though, agreed with my commitment and that this was essentially a double album released in two parts.” <br><br>Cantrell, who sold 11 million albums with Alice In Chains, has come into his own as a solo artist on <u>Degradation Trip</u>, though he&rsquo;s still a part of and happy to connect himself with the band he formed in the early halcyon days of the &rsquo;Seattle Scene.&rsquo; “I didn&rsquo;t associate myself with Alice on Boggy Depot,” he recalls. “I was stepping away from the band, so there was a consciousness of not sounding like Alice. But people&rsquo;s awareness fades,” he realizes. “An Alice fan would know my name, but some guy who just likes the Alice tunes may not know me. I found that when people saw the Alice In Chains MTV Unplugged show, they realized how much I sang, and how many of the songs I&rsquo;d written in Alice. I realized how much Alice was and is a part of me and how proud I am of that band.  And with <u>Degradation Trip</u>, you know who it is when you listen to the record,” Cantrell acknowledges. <br><br>“I&rsquo;ve had people say, &rsquo;it sounds so much like Alice,&rsquo;” which, of course, is a nice complement, as well as a given.  That said, “it&rsquo;s completely different being a full-time lead singer.  A lot more pressure,” he admits.  “I loved what I did on <u>Boggy Depot</u>, but I&rsquo;m growing, I&rsquo;m much more confident and you can tell, vocally. You can hear the growth between the two records. I think it was because of all the shit I was going through, I was so fucking angry, and I had a lot of emotions that weren&rsquo;t very pretty, and it came out of me on this record.”<br><br>He kept that edge from start to finish, beginning with the demo process in his Seattle-area home, where the tunes were laid down on a four-track, all on the same guitar, “It&rsquo;s my white guitar with all the burn marks on it, my Gibson Les Paul. I actually broke the headstock off halfway through the writing, but somehow it stayed in tune! I didn&rsquo;t record the demos very well, just guitar lines and vocals, because sometimes you lose the magic when you try to re-record it. So I get it workable, to where there&rsquo;s still stuff to be explored. And Mike and Robert were big sticklers on me to staying true to the demos. I gave them a lot of respect, and they gave it back. I was real touched by them. They went through it all with me. They bled for it just as much as I did, and it all comes out on the record. This record was a hard, dark journey,” concludes Cantrell. <br><br>“<u>Degradation Trip</u> is an apt title. There&rsquo;s nothing better to describe the songs and experience than that phrase. I think you gotta be a little bit crazy to do this. And the guys who are usually really crazy are usually the better ones. It&rsquo;s a fine line to walk.” And as the dark, dangerous beauty that is Degradation Trip makes very clear, no one does a better job of teetering on that edge than Cantrell.', 2002, NULL),

A town they&rsquo;d rather not have me mention here because of what I&rsquo;m about to tell you.<br><br>Karma To Burn got their start as drug addled teenagers listening to Skynyrd. In an opiated world, fantasies can appear so real. These boys in the hillbilly state wanted to be rock stars. They bought instruments. Built a still in the back yard. Tried to make music and moonshine. The moonshine sucked but the supersonic rumblings sounded good to them. They saw through the blurred vision to a light at the end of the tunnel. After three months, a plan was concocted. <br><br>They made a tape but had no singer. Fuck it. Instrumentals it was to be. Heavy as shit and loud as hell. With no singer and subsequently no lyrics, songs were given numbers as their meager titles. They sent the tape out to labels. With tactics Howard Stern would applaud, they called labels impersonating other bands spewing what the world will soon find out about...the madness and mayhem of Karma To Burn.<br><br>They played a show in NYC and inked a deal with Roadrunner Records. Large room service bills were rung up. Per diem money disappeared. Things were moving along like a train...like their music. They decided to get a singer. Various people tried out. They returned from the land o&rsquo; the lost with horror stories. Karma to Burn was Marlon Brando the singers were Martin Sheen. This was a rock and roll version of Apocalypse Now. One fellow who tried out ended up in the looney bin. No one could make the cut.<br><br>So they enlisted one of their friends. He can&rsquo;t really sing. His sound is more of a distorted warble. He moans and grunts a lot. Due to his dyslexia, they had to name their songs because he sucked at numbers and kept fucking up. So it was to be that their songs would have titles. Titles like &quot;(Waltz Of The) Playboy Pallbearers&quot;, &quot;Appalachian Woman&quot;, &quot;Mt. Penetrator&quot;, and &quot;Twin Sisters and a Half Bottle of Bourbon&quot;. Finally they made it into the studio.<br><br>What you have in your hands is the debut record from Dickey, William, Baka, and Nicholas collectively known as Karma To Burn.

(97, 'Kemuri', '                             <b>What&rsquo;s KEMURI? -Brief BIO</b><br>A re-imported ska/punk band which was born in Japan and brought up in America. The positiveness which is seen not only in their music but also in their lyrics and shows obtained the kids&rsquo; mental sympathy and the band has become very popular among them. Their debut album &quot;Little Playmate&quot; was released world wide accordingly with their popularity and ability. Their cheering fun sound with their policy, PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) is distinctive. They have an oversea management and did a US tour of 40 places from late March to early May in 1998 which is unusually long for a Japanese band. After coming back to Japan, they played at &quot;Fuji Rock Festival 1998&quot;, a big dreamlike rock festival where many overseas and domestic bands play together and did the &quot;No Music, No Life&quot; campaign at Tower Records. They did a nation wide live tour in Japan from February to March in 1999 and played to 1000-2000 people at each show. Then had a tour all around in Japan, and all tickets were sold out at once.<br><br>In 1999, they did a lot of gigs in Japan, and jumped into touring in France, the first Europe gig  for them. Then they released a live recorded album &quot;tabi&quot; recorded at IMP Hall, Osaka, at 23rd Nov which was so well done.<br>Two years passed by. They finished recording 3rd album &quot;senka-senrui&quot;. They had a lot of fateful encounter, parting ,and decision with changing situation. This album includes all of those feelings. They showed themselves as they were. The horn section changed two members from three. FUMIO says, &quot;KEMURI move one step closer to their journey.&quot; During the two years after &quot;77 DAYS&quot;, KEMURI repeated trial and error and considered real meaning of Positive Mental Attitude(P.M.A) philosophy. Then KEMURI came to the conclusion - The answer was &rsquo;continuation&rsquo;. So, KEMURI did their best to make this album.<br><br>KEMURI had a live at FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL this year 2000 again. That was so great. And they will have a tour all over Japan from 26th Sep.2000 to the beginning of 2001.<br>KEMURI keeps moving forward with their great attitude.<br><br><b>KEMURI BIO - Detailed bio</b><br>My memory doesn&rsquo;t recall what day it was, but I first experienced KEMURI playing live at a small club Loft in Shinjuku,Tokyo. There were about 6 bands and KEMURI was the third or the fourth set of that memorable night. <br>Recalling a rumor that the band is particular about playing each song in just 10 odd seconds, I saw with my eyes how the Japanese independent music scene was interesting. <br><br>However, the most impressive of all the 6 bands was KEMURI that brought shivers on my spine with their electrifying stage performance with no waste MC&rsquo;s and absolutely no frills. Since  I was slightly tired to British pop sounds around that time, the stream of their storm-like energy was sufficient to knock me out. Their solid ensemble stood alone without being categorized in the same school of fish with any other band. That was about when Ska was the next big movement in the States. Positive songs, attitude and the power the band well demonstrated were what I was fascinated with. <br><br>Surprisingly enough, that experience further involved me into my first interview with the band during their US tour. What made the tour possible for the band dates back the period even before they found American management with Dave Lumian. Things had already started happening during Fumio&rsquo;s sole visit to the States when he was still handling out demos to various record labels, shops and musicians, or even potential audience at concerts. Among them there was Mike Park, Korean-American, from BRUCE LEE BAND. <br><br>&quot;We&rsquo;ve been good friends since my band contributed 2 songs for the compilation album called &rsquo;Misfits of Ska&rsquo; out from his label. One day, he rang me up and asked me if we were interested in joining Ska Against Racism Tour,&quot; said Fumio. Such offer didn&rsquo;t sound quite new to him since, when he visited Mike before, he saw the label owner busying himself sending out messages about the tour to all sorts of media.<br> <br>&quot;I admit that there was some reaction at first. Why us for the tour against racism? But on the other hand, I thought it might be a good chance for us to go for it and on stage in front of American audience who knew nothing about Japan &quot; Fumio talks about the situation the band was in. DIY spirits is the typical KEMURI style we have come to know. <br><br>According to the initial plans, there was going to be a warm-up tour set up for a couple of weeks before Ska Against Racism Tour, then if the recording session would go good, the band was to be allowed for Warped Tour. That required the band spending almost entire year in the US, and would eventually cause parting company with some original members. Fumio said about this, &quot;There was not much choice left for us, anyway. Time had come, and we needed to move forward.&quot; <br><br>The band revealed totally new member line-up after the biggest turning point. Now there are only two original members, Fumio (vo) and Tsuda (b) left with the late new comer Shoji (ds) who said, &quot;This is what I should do.&quot; tightening up the rhythm section. Minami replaced the original guitar player T (aka Yukihiro Tanaka), and their long-time friend Akihito &quot;Muscle&quot; Masui (currently working with another band called LA-PPISCH) from MUTE BEAT was responsible for the brass position formally occupied by the original member Yuji Shimoda. The last minute addition to the core line-up also saw two new members, Ryo (trumpet) and the saxophonist Kobaken just in time for the up-coming American tour. <br><br>The tour started on March 26 and came to an end on May 10. Not only was it possibly the longest US tour that any Japanese band had ever done, but also physically most demanding KEMURI had experienced. Basically, all the members were packed, and slept in a tour van borrowed from DESCENDENTS. Rare off was spent for band&rsquo;s individual gigs or traveling 1,OOO miles a day... At the end of tour, the total mileage the band had traveled during this chaotic road summed up approximately I 3,700. They immensely played shows each night after moving from town to town just for small advance. &quot;I knew it was gonna be a rough ride and convinced ourselves so before the tour kicked off&quot; recalls Fumio. Tsuda says, &quot; I know it&rsquo;s hard and it doesn&rsquo;t bring us any fortune... We are rather losing money(laugh). But, this is necessary for our band. Then, why not trying to enjoy ourselves as much doing this?&quot; <br><br>It didn&rsquo;t take too long until the band found its way to full ovation by American audience in a given short-20-minute set, and it continued to remain kids&rsquo; favorite until the end of the road. The highest point of all the shows definitely came when the band made their foreign fans shout &quot;Aishitemasu&quot; which means &quot;I love you&quot; in Japanese, the scene vividly captured on their live video released last July. There proves no-frill KEMURI extravaganza in its full swing. <br><br>&quot;I tried to step forward and approach myself more than usual to the audience. That was a quite change,&quot; said Fumio when I had a 4-hour interview with him, Tsuda, Shoji and Ryo right after their US tour. &quot;YOU have to sing in front of people who know nothing about KEMURI every night, so why don&rsquo;t you step forward without hesitation? While I was singing, the monitors were mostly behind me.&quot; <br><br>Such attitude and experience are condensed in this album, and you&rsquo;ll feel KEMURI members unite monolithically as a band from this album. As the title itself shows, the 7 members lived under the same roof together for 77 days sharing the joys, sorrows and pains. It strongly reflects their own experience-what they learned by meeting friends, fans and a new audience during this tour. <br><br>The recording session was done at a studio owned by ALL(DESCENDENTS) in Fort Collins, Colorado. The band arrived there the day after their final show in the US and started rehearsing. After spending three or four days in a sauna-like rehearsal room to complete their songs for the album, they entered into a recording process from the mid May produced by Bill Stevenson and Stephen Egerton, the guitarist and the drummer of ALL(DESCENDENTS). <br><br>The two out of the 14 songs are in Japanese and the rest in English this time. No matter what languages you use, the songs don&rsquo;t sound and mean unless they have something to appeal. However, in this case, I surely caught what KEMURI want to say on their work even if the songs were in English or in Japanese. &quot;77 Days&quot; starts with &rsquo;Heart Beat&rsquo; which they sing doubt and rage against racism. I guess they wrote it based on what they experienced in Ska Against Racism Tour. And &rsquo;PMA&rsquo;, a song about KEMURI itself, follows. This album is full of the songs came out with their faith and attitude. To my regret, there is not enough space here to comment on each song, so I want you to read the lyric sheets in each line. As one of their enthusiastic fans, I&rsquo;m grateful to all the members of KEMURI for completing such an album. <br><br>&quot;European and American bands tour Japan, so why don&rsquo;t Japanese bands go abroad and play live? That&rsquo;s the only reason. Japan or overseas... I don&rsquo;t care. Succeed or fail... Nothing will start unless you stop saying that. It&rsquo;s just started,&quot; said Fumio. &quot;Actually, you can do anything if you believe in yourself. So, I will never give up and will always live with a PMA.&quot;- Yes, that&rsquo;s right. What a nice message to close this writing.  <br><br>After coming back to Japan, they played at &quot;Fuji Rock Festival 1998&quot;, a big dreamlike rock festival where many overseas and domestic bands play together and did the &quot;No Music, No Life&quot; campaign at Tower Records.

(100, 'Madball', '                             While most seven year olds are home on a Sunday afternoon playing video games or watching cartoons, Freddy Cricien is at CBGBs in New York City, there to see his big brother Roger Miret&rsquo;s band Agnostic Front perform at a local hardcore matinee.  Roger brings Freddy to the side of the drum kit, safely away from the rabid fans pressed up against the stage cheering for their favorite band to start the show.  The lights go down and the madness begins.  Bodies climbing over bodies, fingers pointed in the air with every line, and a wide-eyed Freddy watching his brother&rsquo;s every move.  The energy escalates with each song as Freddy waits patiently for his chance to shine.  Finally the moment of truth as Roger turns to his little brother, calls him up to the front of the stage and gives him the mic.  Freddy seizes the moment, giving all in attendance a bite-sized taste of things to come. <br><br><br>Freddy had not yet reached his teens when he played his first Madball show in 1988.  Backed by most of Agnostic Front, Madball&rsquo;s first few gigs consisted of un-used AF songs with Roger on bass, Vinnie Stigma on guitar and Will Shepler on drums.  In 1989 Madball released the seven-inch, “Ball of Destruction”, giving Freddy an outlet to take his show on the road.  Three years of hard work followed, playing regional shows in and around the New York area.  In 1992 guitarist Matt Henderson joined the band, turning Madball into a five-piece just in time to record the “Droppin&rsquo; Many Suckas” EP for Wreckage Records.  One year later Roger left the band, and was replaced by the young blood of Hoya Roc.  Hoya was a familiar face from the local hardcore scene and a good friend of Freddy&rsquo;s.  His prior band Dmize was just breaking up and Hoya was looking for a new gig.  So when Madball asked Hoya to join the band, naturally he jumped at the opportunity.  Finally Freddy had a lineup he could call his own. <br><br><br>Madball quickly earned a reputation as one of the fiercest live bands around, winning over punk and hardcore fans wherever they plugged in their instruments.  In 1994 they caught the eye of New York-based Roadrunner Records, home to such acts as Sepultura, Biohazard and Machine Head, where they would release their next three albums, “Set It Off” in 1994, “Demonstrating My Style” in 1996, and “Look My Way” in 1998.  Madball soon developed a national and international following with their relentless touring schedule that culminated in a 1995 Dynamo Festival appearance in front of 120,000 fans.  The band took their music all over the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia and South America, sharing the stage with acts such as Black Sabbath and Slayer.  Their powerful live show coupled with their notorious streetwise credibility rendered Madball the seminal hardcore act from New York City, headquarters for the music and lifestyle that they proudly represent.  Unrelenting in its assault, Madball&rsquo;s music was the voice of the urban youth, stripped of unnecessary flourishes and delivering the goods with a true clear voice. <br><br><br>In 2000, Madball decided it was time for a change and inked a deal with the legendary independent label Epitaph Records.  Based out of Los Angeles, Epitaph had made a name for itself with the success of west coast bands such as Rancid, NOFX and Pennywise, and was looking to balance their roster with some east coast flavor.  So when Madball released “Hold It Down”, it was a pummeling album in stark contrast to the more melodic punk music that Epitaph was known for.  Nonetheless “Hold It Down” was poised to expose Madball to a larger punk rock audience, one that was ready to swallow a dose of something a bit harder edged than what they were accustomed to.  Unfortunately Madball was forced to disband, due to legal and band issues, in early 2001, shortly after the release of “Hold It Down”, and was unable to take full advantage of their newly found audience. <br><br><br>Now, after a couple years off, Madball is back and ready to pick up exactly where they left off.  Their new material can best be described as “Hold It Down x 100” and should be available sometime this year for release.  They have already hit the road, satisfying a new generation of kids&rsquo; need to see for themselves what this hardcore legacy is all about.  With Freddy and Hoya running the show, Madball&rsquo;s uncompromising attitude and perseverance have undeniably paved the way for something special in 2003.<br>', 1994, NULL);

After all, the man has worked with the likes of Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Breaking Benjamin, and label-mates Killswitch Engage, and he&rsquo;s even helmed Paramore&rsquo;s recent breakout LP, <em>Riot! </em>But by the same token, the two months the band spent with Bendeth -- within the platinum plaque-lined walls of his House of Loud Studios, planted smack dab in the desolate thick of Elmwood Park, New Jersey -- completing the record was ultimately humbling. That&rsquo;s because crafting and tracking what would become their sophomore full-length was an experience tantamount to rock and roll boot camp, according to bassist and backing vocalist <strong>Matthew Leone</strong>.</p><br><p>&quot;David broke us down -- he was like a drill sergeant,&quot; Matthew said, of the first time <strong>Madina Lake</strong> played some of the new material for Bendeth. &quot;I was totally frazzled by the end of the first day. We thought it would be easy, because we knew the songs were there. We just thought we&rsquo;d come in, and record them. But when we played them for him that first time, he just ripped us apart. He completely deconstructed us, and it hurt bad. But the pain was well worth it.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;It was challenging making this record,&quot; echoed brother and lead vocalist <strong>Nathan</strong>, of the band&rsquo;s hard-nosed producer. &quot;But at the end of the day, we are super proud of how it came out. I think we blew the first album out of the water. I guess artists are artists, and in our experience, you bump into people who...let&lsquos just say some have a level of talent that qualify their attitude, and some don&rsquo;t. Bendeth is clearly a guy who does.&quot;</p><br><p>By the end of it, Madina Lake had churned out a monstrous collection of genre-defying, impassioned and infectious tunes which often meld the ethereal, hypnotic elements of Muse with the riff-rife potency of Linkin Park. And the band also found its true sound through the experience.</p><br><p>&quot;The first record was us exploring,&quot; Matthew claims. &quot;With more life and experience under our belts, discovering who we are as individuals and as a group, we made the record that fits who we are now. Every artist and musician, it takes them a minute. We took that time, we toured, and now, we know who we are and that&rsquo;s the record we made.&quot;</p><br><p><strong><em>Attics to Eden </em></strong>is an album that proves maturity comes with experience. One of rock&rsquo;s most promising young acts takes the listener on a unique auditory voyage across layer upon diverse layer of sound. The 12 songs on the album -- including &quot;Never Walk Alone,&quot; &quot;Let&rsquo;s Get Out of Here,&quot; &quot;Legends,&quot; and the guitar-less &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot; -- are replete with otherworldly atmospherics, epic guitars, intricate and oftentimes punishing drum-work, melodic choruses, imposing bass lines, audacious instrumentation, and Nathan&rsquo;s unpredictable, inescapable vocals.</p><br><p>It&rsquo;s a sonic, rock and roll assault on the senses, and Matthew says that&rsquo;s just what the band -- rounded out by guitarist and programming genius <strong>Mateo Camargo</strong> and drummer <strong>Dan Torelli</strong> -- was aiming for.</p><br><p>&quot;Our favorite records were ones that didn&rsquo;t have one dull moment,&quot; Matthew said. &quot;We wanted to make a real record, a genre-less record and a timeless record. I think there are musicians like the White Stripes, where less is more -- undoubtedly. Then there are bands like the Smashing Pumpkins or Nine Inch Nails, where they want all of these components attacking the ears from different angles, at all times. We&rsquo;re the latter, the kind of band that wants as many components as possible.&quot;</p><br><p>Their first major tour in the U.S. came in 2007, as part of Linkin Park&rsquo;s Projekt Revolution run that year&rsquo;s bill also featured My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, and others. They&rsquo;ve hit the road with Paramore and Gym Class Heroes, and have just landed a [MAJOR] slot on this summer&rsquo;s Warped Tour. Bottom line: You should know Madina Lake&rsquo;s story by now. You should also be at least a little familiar with the concept behind Madina Lake, and the Leone brothers&rsquo; metaphorical universe.</p><br><p>The band&rsquo;s first LP bore the modern rock radio hit &quot;House of Cards,&quot; and the follow-up single &quot;Here I Stand&quot; garnered heavy rotation on MTV and Fuse. Madina Lake&rsquo;s Leone brothers, whose mother tragically passed when they were teens, pour their life experiences into their songs, and that helped them quickly rise from basement gigs to one of 2007&rsquo;s biggest festivals.</p><br><p>In <strong>Madina Lake&rsquo;s</strong> earliest beginnings, the band set out to release three albums which would congruently tell the story of <strong>Madina Lake</strong>, a small town of their own creation, which would serve as the canvass for a much larger message. The first chapter focused on the town socialite, who goes missing, and the reaction the town&rsquo;s inhabitants have.</p><br><p>&quot;We wanted to make three installments of this sort of grandiose statement we wanted to make,&quot; Matthew said. &quot;The first one was a statement about celebrity obsession, so this is part two of that, which just continues on the mystery.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;This one goes completely surreal...like universal,&quot; Nathan added. &quot;There&rsquo;s elements of spiritual escape, and almost science fiction elements to it that we went with on this one, but at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re sticking very closely to our main objective with the whole story, which is good vs. evil. We didn&rsquo;t want to repeat anything we did on the first one we didn&rsquo;t even really want to touch on the same topics. But you have to put faith in the kids that support your band to see your vision out and develop with you.&quot;</p><br><p>But one need not know the story to appreciate <strong>Madina Lake&rsquo;s</strong> poetics.</p><br><p>&quot;I think people have the same basic sets of emotions,&quot; Matthew said. &quot;The spectrum of emotions is not that big, so whatever you&rsquo;re talking about, I think people can file it under their own experience.&quot;</p><br><p>&quot;If you do something that&rsquo;s not true to your heart, its going to be contrived and its not going to connect. As much as we try to follow this story line, we make sure they&rsquo;re based on real events and real things that we&rsquo;ve gone through, things we&rsquo;ve experienced, and feel passionately about. I think people around the world can connect to a similar string of emotions that they go through, whether they&rsquo;re in China or Italy or Belarus. People go through the same gamut of emotions and that&rsquo;s first and foremost in our songwriting.&quot;</p>', 2007, NULL),
(102, 'Malevolent Creation', '                             <p>One would think that after more than ten years of cranking out the most blistering of death metal, <strong>Malevolent Creation</strong> would be willing to rest on their laurels, having nothing left to prove. But for the band, every show and every new album is another chance to show the world the true definition of malevolence. </p><p>With unmatched speed, skill, songwriting and sheer force, <strong>Malevolent Creation</strong> is the Mike Tyson of death metal, coming up swinging after every knockdown and biting on the ears of anyone too deaf to listen on their own. They&#39ve endured censorship, massive lineup changes, infighting, and attacks by religious groups, mass media, government and right wing thugs. Through it all, <strong>Malevolent Creation</strong> has stood tall and strong and has never compromised one note nor surrendered one inch of ground. If anything, they&#39ve become more and more aggressive and caustic with each new album.</p><p>The origin of Malevolent Creation can be traced back to their formation 1987 in Buffalo, NY. There they made and gave away 100 copies of their first legendary demo tape, taking their first sue-footed step into the death metal underground. Their 1988 move to Florida set the stage for the recording of their second demo which pressed 1000 copies, establishing them as legitimate contenders in the field. On this second demo, Malevolent Creation used a new drummer and also addd John Rubin on guitar. The next year saw another drummer change with Mark Simpson taking position at the skins. With their strongest lineup at that point, a third demo was recorded leading to a deal with Roadrunner and the release of their first full length album, 1991&#39s <em>The Ten Commandments</em>.</p><p>In 1992, Rubin and Simpson were replaced by longtime pals Rob Barrett on guitar and Alex Marquez on drums for their second album, 1992&#39s <em>Retribution</em>. On 1994&#39s <em>Stillborn</em> release Rubin rejoined the band and drummer &quotCrazy&quot Larry Hawke was hired, replacing Marquez and Barrett. After the 1994 tour to support &quotStillborn&quot, Hoffmann left the band and bassist Jason Blachowicz assumed the vocal duties while Dave Curloss was hired for drum duty, further illastrting the bands revolving door policy. Fasciana makes no excuses for the continual membership changes, stating &quotIf your too slow, you&#39ve got to go.&quot Personal and personnel problems have never stood in the way of the thundering war machine known as <strong>Malevolent Creation</strong>, and those who were injured in battle and left behind must be content with the knowledge that they were part of this behemoth for even a short time. </p><p>(http://www.malevolent-creation.com/sites/updates.htm)</p>', 1991, NULL),

(104, 'Misfits', '                             It was a dark and gloomy night. As if manipulated by an unknown entity, the mass of destruction rolled across the skies in reaction to the baneful yet legendary union that was soon to form. The fury hurled fierce lightning and thunder but ceased its advance when it found its destination and the reason for its creation: a small town in New Jersey called Lodi. It was on that night in the summer of 1977, that the Misfits were born. Taking the title of Marilyn Monroe&rsquo;s last movie as their name in a move to immortalize her image - singer Glenn Danzig and bassist Jerry Only along with drummer Manny, set out to make an impression. They wound up making history.<br><br>Their music was primitive, punk-style rock harsh and to-the-point. What separated the band from their hard-core peers, however, was their inspired fixation on horror movies. They created a total world from their passion for the genre. From the B-movie-style artwork, to the band&rsquo;s appearance - with their slick, black devil locks - to the Fiend  (a skull head that became the official symbol of the group) painted on leather jackets, boots, and equipment, the Misfits cast a fiendish aura of mystery embodied by goulish charm and landed themselves a massive cult following.<br><br>Two decades later, the Misfits are back. Their last album, AMERICAN PSYCHO was released in May of 1997 on Geffen Records.  It re-established them as one of the most aggressive outfits in music and spoke volumes about their influence on many of today&rsquo;s rock acts. From neo-punk bands Green Day, Rancid and Blink 182 to metal acts Metallica, Pantera and Slayer to hard rockers such as Marilyn Manson, White Zombie and Rage Against The Machine, the Misfits have inspired many musicians and much of the music people are watching on TV and hearing on the radio today. In order to fully understand the significance of the MISFITS, however, it is important to trace the band&rsquo;s history back to the beginning.<br><br>Casting their spell on the masses with that first, pre-guitar recording of the 7-inch single &quot;Cough/Cool,&quot; released on their own Blank Records, the Misfits began making plans to record a full-length album. The band was offered free studio time under the stipulation that they change the name of their label due to the pre-existence of a Blank Records. The Misfits agreed, renamed their label Plan 9, and recorded (but never released) their first LP, STATIC AGE, in 1978. Lineup changes followed and by early 1980, the band coalesced around co-founders, singer Glenn Danzig and bassist Jerry Only along with guitarist Doyle Von Frankenstein (Jerry&rsquo;s youngest brother).<br><br>From early 1978 to 1983, the Misfits spawned a rampage of singles, EP&rsquo;s, a live album and two other full-length LP&rsquo;s: WALK AMONG US  (1982) and Earth A.D. / WOLF*S BLOOD  (1983). But then, after a Halloween show in 1983, the Misfits broke up. Nonetheless, the fans spoke - the band&rsquo;s posthumous popularity exploded with a force that slit the throat of logic. Original Plan 9 releases began to fetch inordinate sums with 45&rsquo;s earning to this day as much as $1000 each. Two compilations, LEGACY OF BRUTALITY  (1986) and MISFITS (1987), an unofficial greatest hits, fueled the Misfits fever.  Also keeping the Misfits flame burning was the band&rsquo;s genius for inspiring collectability of anything *Misfit,* making them a phenomenon in pop culture. To interpret their musical treatment of horror and gore, they have used over time a wide array of contemporary visual artists including Basil Gogos (renown for his classic covers of Famous Monsters Magazine), Jurek (who won design awards for his airbrush work of Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix), Ed Repka, Boris Vallejo, and Pushead. Since 1995, the Misfits have released a new T- shirt design every 6 weeks driving collectability. Also available and highly<br>prized among fans, are singles, key chains, skeleton gloves, arm bands (as made famous by Doyle), wall plaques, and collectible model kits - the Jerry kit figurine has just been unveiled.<br><br>Asked why this hunger for all things Misfits endured, bassist Jerry Only ventures: &quot;If you look at what was happening with music in the &rsquo;80s, a lot of it didn&rsquo;t make sense. I think we filled a niche we stuck to what we did, and we did it well. We never tried to pull something over on people - we just tried to entertain &rsquo;em while rocking &rsquo;em real hard. Besides, I think the love of the horror art form has endured.&quot; The Misfits and their 10,000 strong fan club (dubbed the Fiend Club) were instrumental in petitioning and seeking approval for the 1997 release of the U.S. Monster Stamp series which among others, featured Bela Lugosi Sr., (Dracula) and Boris Karloff (Frankenstein). And it was Karloff&rsquo;s daughter, Sara, who in full support of the band offered clearance for the use of clips from the classic &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein,&quot; in their first video ever, &quot;Dig Up Her Bones,&quot; the first single off AMERICAN PSYCHO.<br><br>As Misfits mania continued into the 1990&rsquo;s, Metallica emerged as one of the band&rsquo;s strongest supporters citing the Misfits as a key influence on their music, wearing their T-shirts on stage and even covering one of their songs &quot;Last Caress.&quot; Also jumping on the bandwagon was Guns N&rsquo; Roses who covered &quot;Attitude,&quot; and the Lemonheads with &quot;Skulls.&quot; In February 1997, Caroline Records released VIOLENT WORLD: A TRIBUTE TO THE S, which featured Misfits material interpreted by the likes of Therapy?, Goldfinger, Pennywise, NOFX, Prong and Sick of it All. The growing legion of Misfits fans could only wonder - what had become of the band?<br><br><br><br>Glenn Danzig had moved on to a new outfit, SAMHAIN, and later to fame with the band DANZIG. For nine years, Jerry and Doyle pursued the rights to the Misfits name. Commenting on his resolve to reclaim the Misfits moniker, Jerry said &quot;I didn&rsquo;t know how long it was going to be before I could get the Misfits back on track, but I was going to keep trying because I knew what we had was something special.&quot;<br><br>Misfits once again in January 1995, Jerry and Doyle set out to find a singer. After some 200 auditions and many months later, Michael Graves (ex-Valmont) was awarded the job of singer in October. &quot;We were particularly impressed by his aggressive, maniacal ways but at the same time his vocals were real melodic,&quot; says Jerry. Drummer Dr. Chud (formerly of Dan Kidney, Sacred Trash and Sardonica) had been asked to join the band two years earlier.<br><br>Aside from an inventive approach to music and its visual presentation, their all-encompassing DIY mentality was and continues to be their strong suit. From their Misfits compound in the far reaches of North Jersey which includes even a family owned machine shop business, they craft their own instruments: guitars and bass down to the studded leather straps. Chud makes his own drum sticks. Creativity rules as they design and construct on site their own elaborate stage sets and wide array of infamous props.<br><br>In 1996, on their first world tour in over 13 years, the Misfits demonstrated renewed vigor with shows even more spontaneous and incendiary than those of the earlier Misfits. Armed with their self-crafted instruments, Jerry and Doyle were wild wolves, thrashing and crashing. Already having proven his vocal skills, Michael displayed a dynamic stage presence (he&rsquo;s been known to climb venue walls without ever missing a lyric). Dr. Chud proved himself &quot;a master behind the drum kit,&quot; as Jerry calls him. And new songs like &quot;Mars Attacks,&quot; &quot;Blacklight,&quot; &quot;The Haunting,&quot; and &quot;The Hunger&quot; (all of which appear on AMERICAN PSYCHO ) thrilled the faithful.<br><br>The year 1995 saw two monstrous Misfits releases from Caroline Records: COMPILATION  II and a coffin-shaped box set comprising virtually the band&rsquo;s entire output including their previously unreleased first album, STATIC AGE.  For the many who snapped up these older collections, learning that the Misfits would soon be recording and releasing the new material was a more than welcome surprise.<br><br>In December 1996, the Misfits recorded basic tracks for AMERICAN PSYCHO at Woodstock, N.Y.&rsquo;s Dreamland Recording Studio in just two and a half weeks. As with every other album they had recorded in the past, Jerry and Dr. Chud laid down the rhythm tracks in just two days (that&rsquo;s 17 album cuts, B-sides and bonus tracks). The album was produced by Daniel Rey, who is known for his extensive collaboration with the Ramones. Andy Wallace (Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Slayer) mixed. <br>	<br>&quot;We had 35 songs to choose from,&quot; Jerry recounts. &quot;We narrowed those down and then really analyzed what we were doing. We tightened everything up as much as possible. Sticking to our punk roots, the longest song on the album is three minutes and nine cuts are under two. We&rsquo;ve still got the classic backup vocals, the &rsquo;50s sounding chord progressions, the different beats - 4/4 time can turn into a major thrash beat in the same song. But the sound of our instrumentation is so much better than on our previous records. We worked really hard.&quot;<br><br>Thematically, AMERICAN PSYCHO  is a return to time-honored Misfits concerns: &quot;Vampires, monsters, alien invasion, Frankenstein - we are the Misfits after all,&quot; warns Jerry. Of the band&rsquo;s refusal to  address weightier issues, he explains: &quot;People who buy our records and come to see us perform - from the guy all the way back in the balcony, to the guy getting his head banged around in the front - they come to have a good time. And we make sure they do you can hear about social and political issues somewhere else. See, when you come to a Misfits show, you get a bunch of guys who go out there and give 110 percent (they&rsquo;ve been known to rip through 55 songs a night) take it or leave it. That&rsquo;s what we have always been. At a show, everyone&rsquo;s just part of the crowd there&rsquo;s no them and us - we&rsquo;re all us.&quot;<br><br>This fits with what Jerry says is the key to the new Misfits: team effort.  All the band members participated in the writing of AMERICAN PSYCHO. &quot;When we decided to come out and play as the Misfits again,&quot; Jerry says, &quot;it was going to be all about the new band, taking what we had that was special and moving it forward without sacrificing what we knew the fans would want. It was great having everyone bring something to the table.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&rsquo;ve survived for 20 years,&quot; Jerry reflects. &quot;Maybe the times have caught up with us. And 40 years from now, people will still be playing our albums because we won&rsquo;t water down what we do. Our goal is to keep perspective on who we are and where we&rsquo;re going. When we started playing out, we were surprised to see how many fans, young and old still go nuts for the Misfits. It shows that we have a very strong following and we can still stay true to ourselves and grow as a band.&quot;<br><br>The band signed to ROADRUNNER Records in September of 1998 and are all set to record their first effort for the label.  This follow-up to AMERICAN PSYCHO is due in the second quarter of 1999!<br><br>So with that, kill the lights, let the candles burn behind the pumpkins&rsquo; mischievous grins, and let the skeletons dance. For one thing is certain, The Misfits have returned and once again everyday is Halloween.<br>', 1999, NULL),

(106, 'New York Dolls', '                             <strong><em>&quotMick Jagger stole everything from David Johansen!&quot<br /><br /></em></strong>Morrissey recently exclaimed this with a fervor that somehow made his chronologically impossible claims seem plausible. Watching footage of the <strong>New York Dolls</strong> onstage two years ago at the behest of one of their biggest fans (who was curating the prestigious Meltdown Festival in London) one realized just how vast - and heretofore unsung - their influence truly was. Everyone knows the famous logo: chrome lipstick, scrawling that name across an unseen mirror, but it&#39s more than the great brand. It&#39s not about the androgyny either. Skinny boys were wearing make up long before them. Little Richard. Elvis. It&#39s not even about the music, as the Dolls themselves were always quick to credit 50&#39s R&ampB numbers or early 60&#39s girl group productions as their own influences. Really, what makes the Dolls so eternal is the attitude - it got into rock&#39s water supply and never left. Kiss, Aerosmith, The Ramones, Blondie, The Sex Pistols, The Damned, Motley Crue, Guns &#39N&#39 Roses, Hanoi Rocks, The Strokes, The Libertines and just about any gang of strutting rockers who are convinced that their band could take your band and possibly your whole town in a pretty for pretty, ugly for ugly throwdown. <strong>New York Dolls</strong> and their disciples win, not just with brawn but with what guitarist Sylvain Sylvain calls &quotplenty of intellect and plenty of sex.&quot <br /><br /><strong>The New York Dolls </strong>are, simply, the Beatles of attitude. Thirty five years into their existence (thirty one since they disbanded down in Florida in a haze of smack withdrawal and managerial anarchy), with three men down, they can still take your band, pretty for pretty, ugly for ugly, onstage, and now, with the long (long) awaited follow up to 1974&#39s awesome Too Much, Too Soon, on CD too. <br /><br />&quotYou know how England is,&quot David Johansen quips in his Staten Island drawl, thick as South Ferry sludge, &quotWe made a big noise over there, and we were having so much fun, we decided to keep going.&quot &quotThe phone didn&#39t stop ringing,&quot Sylvain adds, &quotThe kids wanted this. Kids of all ages.&quot An album&#39s worth of brand new <strong>New York Dolls </strong>compositions, as unlikely as it may have seemed in 2003, was a foregone conclusion after wildly successful festival and live dates that spanned the past two years. They were a reunion when they re-started. Now, with replacement members feeling comfortable stepping into the stack heels of departed legends like Johnny Thunders, Jerry Nolan, and most recently Arthur &quotKiller&quot Kane, they&#39re a gang once more. &quotIt won&#39t be very long that we&#39ll be together longer than the original band was,&quot Johansen laughs. <br /><br />And so we have official studio release #3,<strong><em> ONE DAY IT WILL PLEASE US TO REMEMBER EVEN THIS</em></strong>, where the <strong>New York Dolls&#39</strong> hallmarks: perfectly mean riffs, deceptively sweet choruses and miles of that infamous attitude meet the 21st Century. What&#39s the same? &quotI think it&#39s still an up kind of thing,&quot Johansen says describing that quality that makes the <strong>Dolls</strong>, whatever, whomever and whenever, unmistakably <strong>&quot</strong>the <strong>Dolls.</strong>&quot &quotIt&#39s got a non-defeatist philosophy and attitude. It says <em>We can do anything</em>.&quot<br /><br />What&#39s different? Well, listen to a track like the harmonica driven mid-tempo ballad &quotI Ain&#39t Got Nothing,&quot and it&#39s clear that you&#39re also dealing with real survivors. &quotWe are older,&quot Sylvain acknowledges. &quotBut we share the same spirit as when we were fucking 18.&quot They wear it well too. The world-weariness isn&#39t depressive, but rather philosophical - glamorous even. Think mid-period Sinatra (if he&#39d hailed from the Bronx and not Hoboken) or Leonard Cohen (if he were less Canadian). &quotIt&#39s a statement of where we&#39re at in life,&quot Johansen says, &quotLife gets better as it goes along and you&#39re more aware of the totality of the thing. When you&#39re a kid, you can - at least I could - block out the not so happy happy, party party aspects of it. Do I feel like a survivor? Yeah.&quot <br /><br /><strong>The New York Dolls </strong>don&#39t stare into their whiskey glasses too long. The up-tempo, Motown-flavored single &quotDance Like A Monkey&quot would likely inspire heated debate on intelligent design vs. evolution if its tribal rhythm didn&#39t unite believers and pagans out on the dance floor. It should quickly enter the pantheon of great simian songs in rock history. Tracks like &quotGimme Love and Turn On the Light,&quot all blues and garage rock horniness serve to remind (if anyone&#39s forgotten) the &quotsex&quot that is brought to the fore, nudging the &quotintellect&quot back a bit. Iggy Pop&#39s backing vocals punctuate the statement. &quotThere&#39s an attitude we have towards rock n&#39 roll that&#39s kind of fierce,&quot Johansen explains, &quotThere&#39s something in this band where we really want to swing and swing hard.&quot<br /><br />Radio never really &#39got&#39 the <strong>&#39Dolls</strong> in their first time &#39round, and although they were made for MTV, their own timing was off with that phenomenon. Their first two records are in every cool kid&#39s collection today (as they must be) and from &quotLonely Planet Boy&quot off the first record to <em>Too Much Too Soon&#39s </em>&quotHuman Being&quot (not to mention Johnny Thunders&#39 indelible &quotYou Can&#39t Put Your Arms Around a Memory,&quot which the <strong>Dolls</strong> still play live), the guys always had a way with a timeless pop melody. <strong><span><em>One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This</em></span></strong> continues this tradition. &quotTake A Good Look At My Good Looks,&quot is perfectly realized retro-romantic pop. &quotOur producer heard it and said, &#39Syl you still have one foot in the Brill Building&#39,&quot Sylvain laughs. <br /><br />&quotDancing on the Lip of A Volcano,&quot featuring backing vocals from Michael Stipe and a shimmering hook, is easily as catchy as any new pop written by Swedes and not recorded by rock legends. &quotWe thought, &#39Michael Stipe would be great on this,&quot Sylvain explains. &quotAnd so we called him. I live in Georgia and met him at a Patti Smith show. He said to me that he had seen David and I perform and that I handed him a bottle of Perrier. We heard his voice on the track and it was like &#39man this belonged on there all the time.&quot Stipe is one of only a few guests, whose impact on the tracks are subtle. &quotWe got good stuff,&quot Johansen says, &quotWe&#39re a good band. We can do what we gotta do for better or for worse. I didn&#39t feel like we need this, or we need that.&quot <br /><br />Although recorded, mostly live, with producer Jack Douglas (who was an engineer on their self-titled debut, and produced classic albums for Aerosmith, Cheap Trick and John Lennon), this is a cleaner sounding <strong>Dolls</strong>. The rawness is there in the aforementioned attitude, but nobody is pretending Nixon is still in office either. &quotYou can never be amateurish again,&quot Johansen explains, &quotThose two Dolls albums are like folk art. Urban folk art. Alan Lomax could have made them. They captured some Grandma Moses thing. We were so young and new at playing. When I was considering how to go about writing, I was saying, as you go through life and get more skilled at your craft, you can never go back.&quot<br /><br />And so we move forward. &quotThis is phase two,&quot Johansen says. &quotIt&#39s a new band. A whole new thing.&quot Purist fans may scoff that it&#39s not the <strong>New York Dolls</strong> without Johnny, Jerry and Arthur, but both Johansen and Sylvain insist that bassist Sammi Yaffa, guitarist Steve Conte, keyboardist Brian Koonin and drummer Brian Delaney are indeed Dolls now. &quotWe didn&#39t set out to replace anyone,&quot Sylvain reminds us. We&#39re talking about the deceased here, not the dismissed, after all. &quotThey&#39re great guys,&quot Johansen assures those who may be in doubt, &quotThey&#39re part of every aspect of everything. That&#39s what being in a band is all about. I&#39ve got them all psychoanalyzed. Very interesting subjects.&quot <br /><br />Is the world really ready for the <strong>New York Dolls</strong>? &quotI don&#39t care if this record is a hit,&quot Sylvain assures, &quotJust as long as every man, woman and child buys it.&quot<br /><br />- Marc Spitz', 2006, NULL),
(107, 'Obituary', '                             As hard as it is to fathom, Florida death metal pioneers, Obituary, owe a lot to melodic hard rock goofball Andrew WK. The band had been on indefinite hiatus since 1997 and by the middle of 2002 playing together again was the furthest thing on their minds. Singer John Tardy was working at a computer company, guitarist Trevor Peres was in Catastrophic, guitarist Allen West was in Lowbrow, bassist Frank Watkins was hawking mortgages, and drummer Donald Tardy was playing live with Andrew WK. Then, before an Ozzfest gig in West Palm Beach, Andrew WK called John and Frank and invited them to play a few songs onstage with him.<br>  <br>&quot;We hooked up to practice a couple songs and we remembered how fun it was to play together,&quot; John says. &quot;That&rsquo;s all it took. We ended up doing a couple shows that were really well received, and things just snowballed from there.&quot;<br>  <br>In early 2004, Obituary finally decided to start working on their sixth studio record. Often, when bands haven&rsquo;t been together for years, writing sessions are initially strained or unproductive and it takes a while for the musicians to get back on their creative feet. Obituary had no such problem.<br>  <br>&quot;It was really like putting on an old pair of shoes,&quot; John says. &quot;It didn&rsquo;t seem like it had been six years at all, it was more like the blink of an eye. Some of us had longer beards than we used to have but everything felt the same. After about five minutes together, we were totally back at 100 percent.&quot;<br>  <br>One listen to the band&rsquo;s new album, <i>Frozen In Time</i>, and it&rsquo;s clear that Obituary have returned with the same force and fortitude they had in the early &rsquo;90s. &quot;On the Floor&quot; opens with an incisive, churning riff, thunderous beats and bloodcurdling vocals before shifting into a chugging, bone-splintering breakdown, &quot;Blindsided&quot; rides a gradually ascending hate groove to a destination just south of Hell, and &quot;Back Inside&quot; fuses colossal crunch with pummeling double-bass drumming to create a deadly mosh pit firestorm.<br>  <br>&quot;When I sit and listen to it, I hear some songs that sound like they might have come off of our <i>Slowly We Rot</i> record and others that sound like they might have come off of <i>World Demise</i>,&quot; John says. &quot;Then there are others that are unique to us and different than what we&rsquo;ve done in the past. So it&rsquo;s really well rounded, and at the same time, it&rsquo;s the heaviest thing we&rsquo;ve ever done.&quot;<br>  <br>Obituary spent three months writing the album and practiced the songs until they could play them blindfolded. Then, they took a trip down memory lane, coaxing veteran metal producer Scott Burns out of retirement and working with him at their old stomping ground, Morrisound studios in Tampa, Florida. They also worked with producer Mark Prator at his Tampa ProTools Studio, Red Room Recorders.<br>  <br>&quot;That was incredible because we&rsquo;ve watched Mark grow up through the years,&quot; John says. &quot;On our second record, he was emptying garbage cans at the studio, and now he has his own studio. And being back with Scott was amazing. We&rsquo;ve known him so long and he has an instinct for what Obituary should sound like.&quot;<br>  <br>From start to finish, <i>Frozen In Time</i> was created without any major trauma or turbulence. In fact, one of the biggest challenges for Obituary happened after they finished in the studio and were trying to come up with a name for the record. They considered titling it after one of the album tracks, but decided that no single cut could adequately represent the album. They thought about naming it something that would reference to their reunification after seven long years. Finally, they decided they were best off with <i>Frozen In Time</i>.<br><br>“After six years of inactivity, it&rsquo;s like we awakened out of hibernation just as heavy as we were before. It was like our sound was frozen in time, ” John says.  “This album isn&rsquo;t a new beginning, it&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;ve always done - just newer and better.”', 2001, NULL),
(108, 'Pestilence', '                             <p><strong>Pestilence</strong> began in the Netherlands in the mid 1986 as a thrash metal band. The lineup, consisting of Patrick Mameli (guitar, vocals), Randy Meinhard (guitar), and Marco Foddis (drums), recorded two demos before gaining the attention of <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>. After the first demo, Martin van Drunen (bass/vocals) joined them. These two demos - Dysentery (1986) and The Penance (1987) - are raw, sounding mostly like a cross between Possessed and <em>Schizophrenia</em>-era <strong>Sepultura</strong>. After signing to <strong>Roadrunner Records</strong>, <strong>Pestilence</strong> released their debut album titled <em>Malleus Malficarum</em> in 1988, further refining their approach to thrash metal. The new material was tighter and more focused than the demos. Shortly thereafter, guitarist Randy Meinhard left the band to pursue other musical goals in a new band named Sacrosanct.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Pestilence</strong> recruited a new guitar player by the name of Patrick Uterwijk. In 1989, the band released their second album <em>Consuming Impulse</em>, which was a turn toward to death metal. From a musical standpoint, things became heavier and more haunting. Vocally, Martin van Drunen moved away from cleaner vocals in favour of a more acidic growl. With its release, <strong>Pestilence</strong> gained international attention, highly regarded worldwide by death metal fans community. But before a follow-up album was released, the lineup changed once again vocalist and bassist Martin van Drunen departed to front Asphyx.</p><p><strong>Pestilence</strong> were faced again with the challenge of replacing a member, being without a vocalist and bassist. So while recording their third album <em>Testimony Of The Ancients</em> (1991), they enlisted bassist Tony Choy, who at the time was playing with the technical death metal band <strong>Cynic</strong> and Patrick Mameli took over the vocal duties. With this lineup, they released the album <em>Testimony Of The Ancients</em>. The new material was not as abrasive as the previous albums, but the band&#39s musicianship has obviously grown and the album had the best production job of the band&#39s catalogue.</p><p>However, Tony Choy was never a permanent member, and ended up going back to Florida to eventually play with Atheist. In the meantime, <strong>Pestilence</strong> enlisted the talents of Jeroen Paul Thesseling.</p><p>Over the years, the <strong>Pestilence</strong> members were getting into other forms of music, primarily jazz-fusion which, the band wanted to pair with metal. The band&#39s fourth and final album, <em>Spheres</em> was released in 1993. With every album, <strong>Pestilence</strong> went through some kind of a change and <em>Spheres</em> was no exception. <strong>Pestilence</strong> mixed jazz-fusion elements into their death metal style, and used guitar synths throughout the album.</p><p><strong>Pestilence&#39</strong>s popularity had risen with the release of each album, but unfortunately, so did tensions between the members. So after a short period of time, the band unanimously decided to split up, feeling they had reached their creative climax.</p><p>In 1994, <strong>Roadrunner</strong> released one last CD from <strong>Pestilence</strong>: a best-of titled <em>Mind Reflections</em>, containing tracks from all four albums, plus the extremely rare song &quotHatred Within&quot (originally released on the <em>Teutonic Invasion Part II</em> compilation) and six unreleased live tracks recorded in at the Dynamo Open Air Festival in 1992. </p><p>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pestilence_%28band%29)</p>', 2003, NULL),
(109, 'Red Tape', '                             &quot;Toxic. Wasted. Noncomplacent&quot;. That could very well be Red Tape&rsquo;s mantra. It&rsquo;s a genuine message encased in loads of feedback, harmonic distortion, and robust, anthemic sing-a-longs.  On its Roadrunner Records debut, <i>Radioactivist</i>, Red Tape proves to be cut from the same abrasive cloth as genre re-definers like <b>Black Flag</b>, <b>Refused</b>, and <b>A.F.I.</b>, coupled with the grit &rsquo;n girth of early <b>Motorhead</b>.<br><br>Immediately before the inception of the band, Red Tape singer Jeff Jaworski, enlisted in the army for 2 years because he hated his surrounding society. But for his entire life, he&rsquo;s remained deeply passionate about the Northern California.<br><br>&quot;I played music and was going to punk shows since junior high,&quot; recalls Jaworski of his band&rsquo;s incarnation, &quot;seeing bands that made people start a pit - it looked like fun! It was just a matter of time to start my own band cuz I was broke and couldn&rsquo;t play guitar.&quot;<br><br>The singer/guitarist purchased a 4-track, made a demo, and recruited bandmates. The original bass player was named Chuck Berry -no kidding- but after initial jam sessions and the release of <i>High Revoltage</i> on So Cal hardcore label New Age Records, Jaworski realized, &quot;We all came from different musical sorts, and the band members were going along with what I had written. But they had their own interests, and as things progressed, our passions changed.&quot; <br><br>Berry was replaced by Twig Von Wussow, a local punk icon, described by Jaworski as having been in punk bands since birth. Twig had done hard time in <b>The Deseptikons</b>, <b>Spinach</b>, <b>Angora Machinegun</b>, <b>Fatso</b> and countless others. He was a perfect fit for Red Tape, given his gritty punk history, his DIY ethic, his know-how, and his contacts. &quot;We instantly turned into a real band,&quot; admits Jaworski regarding Twig&rsquo;s assimilation into Red Tape. &quot;He also added the back-up vocal aspect.&quot;<br><br>Local axeman Mark Meraji was added as a second guitarist. Since Jaworski plays with harmonics and tunings non-traditional to punk rock, it was hard to find someone whose style meshed.  However, Mark was destined to be the man. &quot;He was a huge influence on me in his old band <b>Double Think</b>, and now I get to play with him!&quot; laughs the singer. Drummer JD had been in bands with Twig, but had quit playing music altogether in order to settle down with this family, but the vinyl collector was soon bitten by the need-to-play bug. &quot;We asked him to join on a Tuesday and he played a show on Friday! He learned 8 songs in 2 days because he was already a fan!&quot;<br><br>With line up firmly in place, the band entered the studio with Amir Derakh (<b>Orgy</b>, <b>Coal Chamber</b>, <b>System Of A Down</b>), who became interested in the band after hearing their self-released EP, <i>Constructivism</i>.  &quot;We did a five-song demo with him that got into the hands of Roadrunner A&R rep Mike Gitter,&quot; says Jaworski. &quot;He came to see us play at Westcoast Worldwide, and offered us a deal a few weeks later.&quot;<br><br><i>Radioactivist</i> was recorded with Derakh and Matt Thorne. While one might raise their eyebrows at the notion of this former glam metal guitarist working with such an indie spirited band like Red Tape, Jaworski defends his work on the album, saying, &quot;Amir is like a gearhead! He&rsquo;s got tons of gadgets but it&rsquo;s old vintage stuff that you can&rsquo;t find at Guitar Center! It&rsquo;s the real stuff that rockers used in the 80s. We used a mixture of his gear and our gear to enhance our guitar tones.&quot;<br><br><i>Radioactivist</i> holds steadfastly to a cool revolutionary vibe &quot;We&rsquo;re thrash-punk&quot; says the singer. &quot;The term &rsquo;hardcore&rsquo; has changed. We&rsquo;re hardcore in the early 80s sense. If it were 1986, we&rsquo;d be a hardcore band. Nowadays, the meaning has changed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Divebomb&quot; is a &rsquo;signature&rsquo; Red Tape tune. &quot;It has that mid-tempo Black Flag beat,&quot; Jaworski explains. &quot;I call it the <b>Neurosis</b> beat, actually! It&rsquo;s like <b>Pain Of Mind</b> and the guitars have a lot of harmonics.&quot; Lyrically, the song is just a big play on words. &quot;I ingest everything around me and then spit it out,&quot; Jaworski says. &quot;It&rsquo;s about being alive, doing your thing and not letting anyone get in your way.&quot;<br><br>The track &quot;High Revoltage&quot; was re-recorded, and it&rsquo;s an &quot;under-a-minute-long blast of stop and go thrash,&quot; a song admittedly influenced by <b>Minor Threat</b> and <b>7 Seconds</b> that speaks of mayhem and unrest, inspired by Jaworski&rsquo;s sojourn to the suburbs. I was frustrated and wanting more out of life, wanting to get out of the house and tear shit up somewhere.&quot; &quot;El Salvador&quot; encourages you to be your own driven hero, set to a <b>At-The-Gates</b>-style beat, while &quot;Shoot! Move! Communicate!&quot; strikes a nerve with street punk kids a scene Red Tape is proud to have close affiliations with. <br><br>Over a 5 year period of existance, Red Tape has shared the stage with such acts as <b>Snapcase</b>, <b>Will Haven</b>, <b>Death By Stereo</b>, <b>The Hope Conspiracy</b>, <b>Botch</b>, <b>Hoods</b>, <b>Sworn Enemy</b>, <b>Bleeding Through</b>, <b>Tsunami Bomb</b>, and many more. Winning over new fans and the respect of fellow musicians.<br><br><i>Radoiactivist</i> has a distinct &rsquo;start the pit!&rsquo; mentality, and is rooted in 1980s punk rock ideals. It&rsquo;s thrash music with melodic singalongs and a moshy, metallic edge. The band makes designs its own merchandise, and still makes and passes out flyers at for their shows, ensuring that it&rsquo;ll always keep a DIY ethic.', 2004, NULL),
(111, 'Sammy Hagar', '                             &quot;The reason I got into this wasn&rsquo;t to be a rock star, it was just to play music,&quot; Sammy Hagar recalled to Rolling Stone in 2000.&nbsp &quot;The first time I ever picked up a guitar, I dug it.&nbsp In my first band, we could only play one song, &ldquoMisirlou&rdquo by Dick Dale, but we played it all day long.&nbsp Finally we learned another one, and then we had two songs we&rsquo;d play again and again and again.&quot;<br /><br />That unpretentious spirit has carried Hagar through a colorful three-decade career that has established him as one of America&rsquo;s most beloved hard rockers.&nbsp From his trailblazing early work with Montrose, to his prolific and popular solo career, his massively successful time with Van Halen, and currently as front man for his band Sammy Hagar and The Wabos, the veteran singer/guitarist has continued to make melodic, hard-charging rock that&rsquo;s short on subtlety but long on punch and personality.&nbsp Performing to hundreds of thousands of concert fans, selling a hundred million CDs, winning Grammy and MTV Awards and, now, being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, are all stats that add up to one spectacular career.<br />&nbsp<br />Many critics consider Montrose to be America&rsquo;s first full-fledged heavy metal act that achieved a level of respect and influence that carries through to this day. On the group&rsquo;s first two albums, 1973&rsquo;s Montrose and 1974&rsquo;s Paper Money, Hagar&rsquo;s fiery vocals and nascent songwriting skills were well-suited to Montrose&rsquo;s inventive guitar work.&nbsp Sammy was now on the national stage. His solo records over the next 10 years are remembered for hits like &ldquoI Can&rsquot Drive 55,&rdquo &ldquoOne Way To Rock,&rdquo &ldquoI&rsquoll Fall In Love Again,&rdquo &ldquoHeavy Metal,&rdquo and super soundtrack songs including &ldquoFast Times at Ridgemont High&rdquo and &ldquoThe Girl Gets Around&rdquo from Footloose.&nbsp Hagar&rsquos single &ldquo55&rdquo sealed his status as a solo star. Three Lock Box, VOA and Standing Hampton were three hard rocking albums.&nbsp His &lsquo70&rsquos anthem &ldquoRed&rdquo has followed him through the years giving him his nickname &ldquoThe Red Rocker&rdquo and given his fans their own identity as the &ldquoRedheads.&rdquo<br /><br />In 1985, he surprised fans and industry observers by accepting an offer to join Van Halen.&nbsp Hagar would remain Van Halen&rsquo;s frontman for the next decade.&nbsp During that period, all Van Halen studio albums, 5150, OU812, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, and Balance, shot straight to #1 on the Billboard charts. Live: Right Here, Right Now peaked at #5 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge won a GRAMMY Award for &ldquoBest Hard Rock Performance with Vocal&rdquo in 1991.&nbsp In 2004 Hagar rejoined Van Halen for a reunion tour that wowed audiences across America. <br /><br />In the interim, Sammy formed The Wabos, the band he plays with to this day.&nbsp With The Wabos, he produced more great CDs and more great concerts.&nbsp Hagar continued to invent numerous ways to live the fun-filled party and music-centered life.&nbsp His most recent Birthday Bash celebration was anything but usual at his Cabo Wabo Cantina in the sunny climes of Cabo San Lucas.&nbsp A few thousand fans and some friends including Kenny Chesney, Chad Kroeger from Nickelback, fellow Van Halen-ite Michael Anthony, Jerry Cantrell from Alice in Chains, Chad Smith from the Chili Peppers, Billy Duffy from The Cult, as well as Ted Nugent and Toby Keith joined in the fun.<br />&nbsp<br />Hagar has further shown his entrepreneurial talents as he owns and markets one of the world&rsquos finest tequilas &ndash Cabo Wabo. Introduced into the US in the late 1990&rsquos, Cabo Wabo tequila has become one of the fastest growing and most sought after brands in the distilled spirits industry.&nbsp The tequila is currently one of the top two selling ultra premium tequilas in the country, with sales growing in double digits for a number of years. Now, Sammy has a new partner, Campari that will take Cabo Wabo Tequila to the global market.&nbsp Always expanding his world, Sammy has just launched Cabo Wabo Radio, an internet station that originates straight from the Cantina in Mexico. You never know what the Red Rocker will do next. But stay tuned.&nbsp <br /><br />Sammy remains one of music&rsquos most beloved personalities, definitely one of the happiest and shows no sign of losing the passion that first inspired him to rock.&nbsp As he told CNN in 2002, &quot;The blues guys&mdashJohn Lee Hooker, Lightnin&rsquo; Hopkins, Muddy Waters and all those guys&mdashthey sang and played until they died.&nbsp They got onstage and played the blues and no one asked them, &rsquo;Hey are you getting too old for this?&rsquo;&nbsp But for some reason people think rock is different.&nbsp Well, it&rsquo;s not.&quot; <br />', 2008, NULL);

First, <strong>Trivium</strong> frontman Matthew K. Heafy saw <strong>Sanctity</strong> and was so blown-away that he helped get them a record deal. Then, <strong>Megadeth</strong>&#39s Dave Mustaine caught <strong>Sanctity</strong>&#39s performance during a show with <strong>DragonForce</strong> and immediately offered them a vaunted spot on the second outing of his <strong>Gigantour</strong> festival. &quotHe came backstage and asked us personally to do the show,&quot drummer Jeremy London recalls. &quotThat was such a huge honor because we all love <strong>Megadeth</strong> and Dave has been one of our idols all of our lives.&quot</p>  <p><br /> It&#39s easy to see why the top names in metal are going to bat for <strong>Sanctity</strong>. <strong><em>Road to Bloodshed</em></strong>, the band&#39s debut, is a blistering blend of technical thrash and old-school metal powered with plenty of attitude and grit. Filled with steely, staccato guitars, trampling beats and roaring vocals, the songs marry complex arrangements and musicianship with granite-heavy grooves and unforgettable hooks. &quotWe all grew up listening to Metallica, <strong>Megadeth</strong>, Slayer and Pantera, and no one&#39s really playing music in that classic thrash style anymore,&quot London says. &quotBut at the same time, we like to write songs that aren&#39t dated and will stand the test of time.&quot</p>  <p><br /> In an increasingly lethargic music scene, <strong><em>Road to Bloodshed</em></strong> is a shot of adrenaline and a bold etching in the pages of metal history. Fan-favorites &quotBeneath The Machine&quot and &quotZeppo&quot feature harsh, tuneful vocals backed by a fast, crunchy guitar rhythm, hammering beats and melodic leads. &quotSeconds&quot starts with singer Jared MacEachern crooning &quotYour life is ending seconds at a time&quot before launching into a violently surging medley of frantic drums and guitar. Then the band goes into &quotBilly Seals,&quot which follows a symphonic intro with an electronic rhythm that has machine-gun ferocity and timeless thrash riffage. &quotEverything we do is a collaborative effort,&quot London explains about how the diverse songs coalesce. &quotUsually [guitarist] Zeff [Childress] will come up with a riff, and then he and I will work the song out a bit. Then Jared will come in and help shape it and give it a dynamic voice.&quot</p>  <p><br /> &quotMost of the vocals require a real aggressive style, but we definitely have our melodic side, too,&quot MacEachern adds. &quotI sang in church choir between the ages of 5 and 13, so I try to put some of that in there as well.&quot One reason <strong>Sanctity</strong> sound so tight and in tune is because Childress and London have been friends since they met in their first grade class. Over the years, they jammed together, then started a band in the seventh grade. Individually, they bounced from band to band playing a variety of styles until they were sophomores in high school. They decided to play together again and make music they were actually proud of. &quotI was in this southern rock band I was really sick of, so Zeff and I decided to start playing metal,&quot recalls London. &quotI was playing bass at the time, and he had me switch to drums.&quot For the next two and a half years, <strong>Sanctity</strong> went through several vocalists and bassists and played numerous local shows. But the turning point came when MacEachern saw one of their gigs at his college. </p>  <p><br /> &quotI was blown away instantly,&quot he says. &quotThey were really exciting to watch and I started really getting into it, so I jumped onstage and did &quotCreeping Death&quot by Metallica with them, and there was this instant connection. Right after the show they said, &#39Hey, we need a singer. Wanna come by practice and try out?&#39 So I dropped out of college and joined the band.&quot<br /> <strong>Sanctity</strong> wrote a batch of songs, self-released a pair of EPs and toured exhaustively, playing 190 shows in 2005 alone. At one of the concerts, they shared a bill with <strong>Trivium</strong> and Fear Factory, and before they went on, they asked the guys in <strong>Trivium</strong> to check them out for some constructive criticism. Fortunately there was little to criticize and <strong>Trivium</strong> were way more than constructive. </p>  <p><br /> &quotWe&#39ve really liked those guys since their first album, so their feedback meant a lot,&quot London says. Heafy recommended us to Monte Conner at <strong>Roadrunner</strong>. Monte gave us a call and we sent him our two EPs and we put a live DVD together.&quot Conner liked what he heard and asked <strong>Sanctity</strong> to write some new songs and record him a high-quality demo. London called Heafy, who turned them on to <strong>Trivium</strong>&#39s producer Jason Suecof.</p>  <p><br /> &quotWe did a big benefit show to raise the money to record the demo,&quot London says. &quot600 people showed up. For the other half of the money, we took a loan out, so we went in with Jason and did &quotZeppo,&quot &quotSeconds&quot and &quotLost to Ego&quot and sent them back to Monte. &quotHe really liked the songs, but he said he wanted to hear more to see where our music was going. We then went back to the studio with Jason to do four more songs.&quot Those tracks, &quotRoad to Bloodshed,&quot &quotOnce Again,&quot &quotBrotherhood Of Destruction&quot and &quotBilly Seals&quot demonstrated real musical growth and proved <strong>Sanctity</strong> could continually deliver the goods. Seeing that, Conner flew out to see them live, then signed them to the label.</p>  <p><br /> With a deal in hand, <strong>Sanctity</strong> returned to Suecof&#39s studio in Sanford, Florida to finish writing their first full album. Along the way, they lost their bassist and re-hired Derek Anderson who had filled in previously, but that&#39s not what locked the band&#39s creative brakes for nearly a month. &quotWe were just working so hard to write songs and were really working against ourselves because we were trying so hard,&quot MacEachern says. &quotSo we took a week off and relaxed and let the music do what it does on its own. And from there everything went really smoothly.&quot With the songs for <strong><em>Road to Bloodshed</em></strong> finally written, <strong>Sanctity</strong> went back into the studio with Suecof in high spirits. &quotIt was so easy and so much fun,&quot London says. &quotJason really brings out the best in everybody. He has a good ear and can hone in on the small things that might need to be changed. I tracked 14 songs in 12 hours and Derek did his bass parts in three hours. The guitars and vocals took a little longer, but in comparison to other bands, we worked really fast and had a great time.&quot &quotIt&#39s our first record and I&#39m super excited about it,&quot says McEachern. &quotBut I&#39m looking ahead and I can&#39t wait to do our second, third and fourth record. I look at this all as the beginning of an amazing process that I&#39ve been waiting for my whole life.&quot</p>  <p><br /> From the acrobatic beats and squealing guitar harmonics of &quotRoad to Bloodshed&quot to the off-time riffing and abrupt bursts of &quotBrotherhood Of Destruction,&quot <strong>Sanctity</strong> have tapped into something equally virulent, vibrant and relevant and created the kind of album that causes chills from the first to the 100th time you listen to it. <strong>Sanctity</strong> may consider bands like <strong>Megadeth</strong>, Slayer, and Metallica to be primary points of influence, but ten years from now, a new generation of bands could easily be getting the same type of inspiration from <strong><em>Road to Bloodshed</em></strong> and the many <strong>Sanctity</strong> offerings to follow.</p>  <p>&nbsp</p>    ', 2007, NULL),
(113, 'Sepultura', '                               <p>December 16, 1996: A day that will live in infamy eternally for <strong>Sepultura</strong> fans.<br /> <br /> That night, following a sold-out performance at London&#39s hallowed Brixton Academy, singer/guitarist Max Cavalera left the band he co-founded more than a decade earlier. While <strong>Sepultura </strong>would continue on without Cavalera, who soon re-emerged with <strong>Soulfly</strong>, his departure marked the end of an era for a legendary, trailblazing group All Music Guide praises as &quotperhaps the most important heavy metal band of the 90s.&quot<br /> <br /> In certain respects, 1996 was the most successful year in <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s storied history. Its sixth album, <em>Roots</em>, earned the group its highest critical praise to date. The band also participated in the inaugural Ozzfest tour, where it performed before the largest American audiences of its career. <br /> <br /> But tensions within the group had been running high ever since the August 1996 death of the teenage son of the band&#39s manager, who was also Cavalera&#39s wife. When the rest of the band -bassist Paulo Jr., lead guitarist Andreas Kisser and drummer Igor Cavalera -approached Max about finding new management just months after the tragedy, he viewed the suggestion as a form of betrayal and severed ties with Sepultura shortly thereafter.<br /> <br /> Luckily for fans, the final concert with <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s most celebrated lineup was recorded, and the resulting double-CD Live at Brixton documents one of the most powerful metal bands of all time. Although it features three covers - Motorhead&#39s &quotOrgasmatron,&quot Titas&#39 &quotPolicia&quot and the Cro-Mags&#39 &quotWe Gotta Know&quot (featuring guest-stars Strife, a hardcore band that served as the tour&#39s opening act) - the album also provides a thorough retrospective of <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s first decade of destruction. <br /> <br /> Included are well-known favorites such as &quotNecromancer,&quot the first song the group ever recorded &quotBiotech Is Godzilla,&quot featuring lyrics written by the Dead Kennedys&#39 Jello Biafra &quotRatamahatta,&quot sung in the band&#39s native Portuguese &quotInner Self,&quot the track for which <strong>Sepultura </strong>shot its first music video and &quotAttitude,&quot which Cavalera dedicates to his late stepson, Dana.<br /> <br /> Because it was recorded during the <em>Roots</em> tour, Live at Brixton - mixed by veteran producer Colin Richardson (Machine Head, Fear Factory) - naturally showcases renditions of many songs from that album. The album also features several tracks from each of the three Sepultura records - <em>Beneath the Remains</em>, <em>Arise</em> and the gold-certified <em>Chaos A.D.</em> - which many metal observers consider to be landmark releases and cornerstones of the genre. <br /> <br /> Although <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s first two albums, <em>Morbid Visions</em> and <em>Schizophrenia</em>, garnered the group much attention in its native Brazil, it wasn&#39t until the 1989 release of <em>Beneath the Remains</em> that the band earned mass worldwide acclaim. Called &quotone of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time&quot by AMG, it led to <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s first international tour. No other Brazilian metal band had ever achieved such success abroad.<br /> <br /> The group re-teamed with <em>Beneath the Remains</em> producer Scott Burns - also well known for his work with extreme acts such as Cannibal Corpse, <strong>Deicide</strong> and <strong>Obituary</strong> - on 1991&#39s <em>Arise</em>. Due to its apocalyptic religious imagery, the controversial music video for the title track was banned by MTV, but the album - praised by CMJ as &quotone of the heaviest albums you&#39re likely to find&quot - still sold more than a million copies worldwide. To support the record, Sepultura toured even more extensively internationally, performing two sold-out stadium concerts in Indonesia and also appearing at Holland&#39s giant Dynamo Open Air festival. <br /> <br /> The success of <em>Arise</em> led Roadrunner to strike a co-distribution deal with Epic Records for the 1993 release of <em>Chaos A.D.</em>, a recording that prompted Rolling Stone to laud the group as &quotthe undisputed leader of the neo-metal pack.&quot Featuring the singles &quotTerritory&quot and &quotRefuse/Resist&quot - both of which are included on Live at Brixton - the album went GOLD furthering Sepultura&#39s reputation as metal pioneers, and saw the band begin to incorporate both political commentary and native Brazilian rhythms into their music for the first time. <br /> <br /> Those rhythms figure even more prominently into <em>Roots</em>, hailed by CDNOW as &quota career high point (that) took metal in a direction few headbangers would dare go.&quot The record&#39s extended percussion passages - as portrayed in the live rendition of &quotEndangered Species&quot - added exciting new elements to the group&#39s still-fierce sound. Ten of the album&#39s 16 tracks were included in <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s Brixton Academy set.<br /> <br /> Nearly six years have passed since Cavalera left Sepultura, but the band&#39s impact on hard music continues to reverberate. The group&#39s influence extends to current heavyweights such as Godsmack, System of a Down and <strong>Slipknot</strong>, while young fans discover Sepultura for the first time with each new release by both Cavalera&#39s Soulfly and Sepultura itself. <br /> <br /> In other words, <strong>Sepultura</strong>&#39s legacy is ensured. It&#39s now time to go back to the Academy for a history lesson you&#39ll never forget.</p>    ', 1990, NULL),

But help is on the way, as Wednesday 13 stands ready to shock the rock status quo out of its brain-dead coma.  Equal parts artist, horror and TV addict, and riveting frontman, Wednesday 13 refuses to be your typical messiah.  “I don&rsquo;t like anyone preaching to me – that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve never gone to church.” says Wednesday. “For me, music has always been an escape from real life. Whatever problems I had, I could always go home, put on a record and just escape all of that shit. So in my own music, the only thing I&rsquo;m serious about is not being serious!”<br><br>Though best known for fronting the Murderdolls, Wednesday is a rock veteran who&rsquo;s been playing in bands since he was 15-years old. He adopted his stage moniker in 1995, naming himself after Wednesday of The Addams Family and the address, 1313 Mockingbird Lane, of The Munsters. A year later he formed his now-deceased horror-core band Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13, named in the spirit of legendary B-movie director Ed Wood. The band put out four independent albums between 1996 and 2001, and played countless local shows. Frankenstein Drag Queens was Wednesday&rsquo;s baby, and he slaved away for his undead offspring - writing the songs, booking shows, working low-wage jobs (delivering everything from newspapers to furniture), and generally putting all his money and energy into the band. <br><br>In 2001, the &rsquo;Drag Queens independent releases and loyal underground following caught the attention of national artists, as Wednesday was asked by the (since departed) Murderdolls guitarist Tripp Eisen to join the band.  Wednesday started in the bass slot, but his talent and showmanship quickly resulted in a move to the lead vocalist position.  It was he and band founder Joey Jordison of Slipknot who collaborated on the writing of the band&rsquo;s debut album, <i>Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls</i>.  The Murderdolls quickly built a fiercely devoted following, through repeated world tours (including 30,000-person shows in Japan, opening slots for Iron Maiden throughout Europe, and other choice tours), and worldwide rock press acclaim and album sales followed.  As 2003 came to an end, <i>Beyond…</i> had earned silver-status in the UK, sold over 100,000 units in the U.S. alone, and garnered accolades including Kerrang!&rsquo;s Readers Choice Award “Best New Band and Album of 2002” and Metal Hammer&rsquo;s “Thank God They&rsquo;re Not Good Charlotte” award in 2003.  Predictably, the success of the Murderdolls resulted in Wednesday disbanding his first band.   But since the Frankenstein Drag Queens&rsquo; demise, it has ironically won a worldwide cult following. Wednesday can&rsquo;t help but laugh: “In the beginning, the &rsquo;Drag Queens were inspired by Ed Wood.  In the end, the band was like Ed Wood in that he wasn&rsquo;t popular until after he died either.”<br><br>Murderdolls, meanwhile, was put on hold in 2003 as Jordison returned to the studio and the road with Slipknot.  Wednesday returned home, immediately locked himself in his basement, and emerged with over 100 songs written.  In June 2004, he began work on his first solo album, playing all but the drums himself.  True to form, Wednesday has stitched together a morgue-full of influences – horror films, cartoons, punk and heavy metal – into a spook-tacular monster-mosh of an album, <i>Transylvania 90210: Songs of Death, Dying and the Dead</i>.  Fans of White Zombie, Rob Zombie, AFI, Alkaline Trio the aforementioned &rsquo;Dolls, as well as metal, punk, and horror in general will find the record at once refreshing and outrageous. With his sallow complexion and raven dreadlocks, Wednesday may look like a grim goth at first glance, but the singer/guitarist is more a throwback to the days of Alice Cooper and Twisted Sister, when rock music had no more pretentious aspirations than being over-the-top, escapist fun.<br><br>The song “I Walked with a Zombie”, for instance, was inspired by the 1943 horror movie of the same name. “It&rsquo;s one of the first movies that dealt with voodoo,” the singer/guitarist explains. “But I just went in a totally different direction – the song is actually kind of a love song about a zombie.”<br><br>The song “Elect Death for President”, meanwhile, was inspired by the TV news. “I was watching CNN last year, and I was like &rsquo;You know, this is scarier than any horror movie,&rsquo;” Wednesday recalls.  “I&rsquo;m not a political person, but it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to realize that there are problems. So I started making up sarcastic lyrics about a campaign where Death was actually running for president. I felt kind of weird afterwards, like “Did I just write a political song? Or not?&rsquo;”<br><br>The recording now behind him and the bloody, infectious results commited to tape, the singer/guitarist is burning to sink his fangs into the rock world&rsquo;s throat once again.  Despite his writing and performing the record himself, Wednesday 13 is a band, which includes Wednesday on vocals/guitar, Ghastly on drums, Kid Kid on bass and Pig on guitar.  Once the record was done, the band immediately hit the road, playing a 16-date club tour of the UK/Europe to warm up the new material.  The tour was a great success, drawing thousands of fans and affirming Wednesday&rsquo;s ability to connect with fans, whatever the project.<br><br>Growing up a little blonde kid in the middle of the Bible Belt (North Carolina, where he still resides), Wednesday escaped at an early age into a world of creature features and rock gods. “I&rsquo;m the perfect example of what television and rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll can do to a kid with no plans to be a doctor or fireman,” says Wednesday. “I still sort of live inside of a television. My songs stem from movies and things I&rsquo;ve seen on TV.”  It seems natural, then, that each track on <i>Transylvania 90210</i> is an episode in the outrageously shocking mini-series that Wednesday 13 created.

The idea was not to be funny.&quot;<br /><br /> Dan: &quot;If people laughed we&rsquo;d be like<br>&lsquoah we dogged it&rsquo;. We wanted it to die on its feet. Literally people would just<br>stand there and there&rsquo;d be this awful silence. You know like in The Office when<br>there&rsquo;s a dreadful silence, and the next day we&rsquo;d be like &lsquoAh that was amazing<br>that bit, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; We still love dying on our feet sometimes.&quot;<br /><br /> Murph: &quot;It was a lot of silliness. The<br>idea of the band was to be stupid. We were just idiots.&quot;<br /><br /> But this was back in 2003, when <strong>The<br>Wombats </strong>were enrolled in Paul McCartney&rsquo;s Liverpool Institute Of Performing<br>Arts (LIPA). Local lads Murph and Dan, despite playing cricket against each<br>other for their respective schools near Strawberry Fields, only actually met<br>each other at LIPA aged 19 when Murph turned up trolleyed at Dan&rsquo;s flat. Murph<br>thought Dan was &quot;a complete muppet with pink and grey hair&quot;, Dan (quite<br>rightly) thought Murph was a &quot;fellow piss-head&quot;. So naturally they started<br>playing gigs together (at The Cavern Club, notably) before they nabbed bassist<br>Tord &Oslashverland Knudsen (fresh at LIPA from his hometown of Elverum in Norway) from the<br>seven other bands he&rsquo;d joined within a fortnight of arriving. Armed with such<br>early wonky pop classics as &lsquoThe Ostrich Song&rsquo; and a tune now only remembered<br>by the band as &quot;the standing at the bus stop one&quot;, the three - plus an American<br>guitarist called Ben who was in the band for a few months, whose speciality was<br>a Mexican &quot;areeeeba!&quot; noise - embarked on four years of tall tales of boys and<br>girls and marsupials.<br /><br /> &quot;We fiddled ourselves a gig in a place<br>called Hannah&rsquo;s Bar in Liverpool,&quot; Murph recalls, &quot;and we didn&rsquo;t really have a<br>name and me and Dan went through a period of calling each other Wombo.&quot;<br /><br /> Dan: &quot;Basically Wombo the Wombat was a<br>fictional kind of character in our daily talk.&quot;<br /><br /> Murph. &quot;We used to call each other<br>&lsquostupid wombats&rsquo; as well, and then we needed a name for this first gig so Dan<br>was like &lsquojust call us <strong>The Wombats&rsquo;</strong>.&quot;<br /><br /> Dan: &quot;And the guy just laughed and went<br>&lsquoyeah, that&rsquo;s funny, that&rsquo;ll do for now&rsquo;.&quot;<br /><br /> But it wasn&rsquo;t too long before Liverpool had to start taking<strong> The<br>Wombats</strong> very seriously indeed. Ditching the sanatorium moods and comedy outfits<br>(although they went through a &quot;stripe period&quot; before settling on their<br>trademark primary colour t-shirt look) they set about playing their infectious<br>punka pop deviance around Liverpool and beyond. Their gigs were laced with a<br>cappella intros, between-song stand-up and Facts Of The Day (did you know that<br>rabbits aren&rsquo;t nocturnal, they&rsquo;re crepuscular? Not until you went to a <strong>Wombats</strong> gig you didn&rsquo;t). They took every gig they were offered,<br>whichever corner of the country it was in (using Dan&rsquo;s granny&rsquo;s Postman Pat van<br>to get there) if plotted on a map, their travels would look like the crazed<br>scrawlings of a madman.<br /><br /> Over the next two and a half years of casual gigging (about one<br>gig a fortnight) they played at a pub in London called Lark In The Park under<br>the impression it was a big open-air festival they played the legendary Three<br>Fat Fish in Exeter they got management offers from tattooed amphetamine<br>maniacs at 3am in Tottington and they were selected by LIPA to go to China to<br>play to 20,000 people at Beijing&rsquo;s Midi festival: &quot;It was<br>basically kids from the streets, that was the idea of the festival,&quot; says Dan.<br>&quot;For some reason we were the &lsquokids from the streets&rsquo; from the UK. It was<br>amazing&quot;. <br /><br /> Things<br>got even bigger last March when they were invited to play Canadian Music Week:<br>a far cry from their first gig outside Liverpool two years previously, in a<br>remote Norwegian fishing village called Stord.<br /><br /> &quot;My girlfriend&rsquo;s from there,&quot; Dan explains, &quot;and I basically<br>played with her in a band as well, a kind of folk trio thing. They suggested<br>doing some gigs together over in Norway and I wanted to go there for the summer<br>anyway so we said &lsquoyeah that&rsquo;d be brilliant&rsquo;. It ended up with us playing in<br>the centre of Stord - if you can imagine an island in the fjords, and us<br>playing the one pub in the centre. The night was billed as country rock and all<br>these people came to it and a couple of these elder members of Norwegian<br>society came, but they left shouting &lsquothis is the worst music I&rsquo;ve ever<br>heard!&rsquo;&quot;<br /><br /> Meanwhile, back in Liverpool they launched their own club night,<br>&lsquoLittle Miss Pipedream&rsquo;, at the Liverpool Carling Academy. They had a regular<br>place to play and Murph&rsquo;s songwriting could evolve. Not too far off the &lsquosilly&rsquo;<br>bracket, but certainly towards the more &lsquoheartfelt&rsquo;.<br /><br /> The KIDS label got to hear of the stir going on up in the &lsquoPool<br>after Radio One&rsquo;s Rob Da Bank played &lsquoHappily Screwed&rsquo; in October 2005 by this<br>time they already had seven self-financed EPs under their belts, all recorded<br>at LIPA&rsquo;s freely available studios. And a touchingly warped pop collection they<br>were, largely based on Murph&rsquo;s foiled romantic encounters.

By the release of third single &lsquoBackfire At The Disco&rsquo; in<br>April 2007 the band not only gained major video rotation on MTV2 for their<br>rip-off of Cliff Richard&rsquo;s &lsquoWired For Sound&rsquo; promo, but also became the first<br>officially unsigned act to sell out Liverpool&rsquo;s Carling Academy and have thus<br>been declared fully-fledged local heroes.<br /><br /> Luckily, the entire indie nation was<br>beginning to see their point. After supporting Kaiser Chiefs in Europe and<br>Babyshambles on their Christmas 2006 UK tour, <strong>The Wombats</strong> signed to 14<sup>th</sup> Floor Records mid-way through what scientists believe to be the longest and<br>most excruciating UK tour known to rock: 50 dates with around 4 days off. &quot;We<br>asked them to book us a &lsquoridiculous&rsquo; tour,&quot; says Dan, &quot;it&rsquo;s the<br>biggest tour anyone&rsquo;s ever booked. We were going to do it without drinking but<br>me and Murph lasted until about the twentieth date then I fell off the wagon,<br>got run over by it a few times and vomited all over the hotel room&quot;). And<br>simultaneously, latest single &lsquoKill The Director&rsquo; became not just another<br>dancefloor hit but a real-life big boys chart hit too, hitting Number 35 in<br>June 2007. Not bad for a song inspired by a shonky romantic comedy with Jude sodding<br>Law in it.<br /><br /> &quot;It&rsquo;s<br>about my current girlfriend and that film The Holiday,&quot; Murph explains. &quot;We<br>were in the Lake District and we went to this posh cinema in Bowness where you<br>go for a meal first then you go and watch the film. That was the only film on<br>and it was absolutely appalling but it seemed quite apt, the cheesiness of it<br>all, when actually things were just horrendous. It definitely didn&rsquo;t mirror my<br>life.&quot;<br /><br /> Next stop<br>for these wild, wibbly Wombat boys is a rampage around a recording studio to<br>record an album Murph hopes will bring them &quot;world domination&quot;, and promises<br>will be &quot;fun, with dark undertones thrown in there. There&rsquo;s a few dark<br>undertones in the lyrics, especially the new songs, a bit of self-deprecation<br>going on, it kinda feels dark to me.&quot;<br /><br /> Ardent<br>fans, however, might be concerned at the non-appearance anywhere on the record<br>or artwork of one Cherub, a cuddly Wombat who has graced Murph&rsquo;s guitar amp<br>during recent live shows, being introduced fondly to the crowd at each show.<br>Cherub came into their lives as a free gift that came with the crate of Wombat<br>Hill wine their label bought them to celebrate signing their contract and left<br>their lives a few short months later when someone nicked it from the stage at<br>KOKO.<br /><br /> &quot;He&rsquo;s got<br>his own Myspace now,&quot; says Murph. &quot;That person who took him made a Myspace and<br>then added most of our friends.&quot;<br /><br /> You could<br>always order another crate of the wine.<br /><br /> Dan:<br>&quot;We&rsquo;ve done that and the guy didn&rsquo;t put one in. They&rsquo;re like &pound27 a go, we&rsquo;ve<br>ordered six of them but the last instalment of the wine has been and gone with<br>out a cuddly Cherub to speak of.&quot;<br /><br /> <br /> Jesters,<br>ostriches, madmen, rollerskates, rom-coms, strippers, lesbians, chart hits,<br>boys, girls and cuddly marsupials. You have to wonder - what would Paul<br>McCartney have made of what he&rsquo;s spawned?<br /><br /><br /> &quot;My only<br>encounter with him was in LIPA,&quot; says Murph. &quot;We had this one-on-one<br>songwriting tutorial, we just talked about songs and I played him some and he<br>said some things. It was when he was going through the whole divorce thing and<br>he had to keep running out to speak to his lawyer on the phone. So he darted<br>out, came back in, then - no word of a lie - I said &lsquothis song&rsquo;s about falling<br>in love with a whore, it&rsquo;s called &lsquoPatricia The Stripper&rsquo;&rsquo; and he said &lsquooh, I<br>could imagine that&rsquo;s a bad thing to do.&quot;<br /><br /><strong> The<br>Wombats</strong>: you really HAVE to be there.<br /><br />', 2008, NULL);

(127, 'Eric Clapton', '<p>ERIC CLAPTON<br/>CLAPTON<br/>REPRISE RECORDS<br/>September 28, 2010</p><p>&quotThis album wasn&#8217t what it was intended to be at all,&quot says Eric Clapton. &quotIt&#8217s actually better than it was meant to be because, in a way, I just let it happen. It&#8217s an eclectic collection of songs that weren&#8217t really on the map&#8212and I like it so much because if it&#8217s a surprise to the fans, that&#8217s only because it&#8217s a surprise to me, as well.&quot</p><p>On CLAPTON, his nineteenth solo album, the only person who has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame three separate times explores the wide range of influences that helped to form his musical sensibility. From a glimmer of an idea&#8212a wish to record some of the jazz standards that he grew up with alongside songs by his frequent collaborator and inspiration JJ Cale&#8212Clapton created a collection that touches on everything from century-old traditional brass bands to little-known country blues to brand-new originals. The result is both relaxed and revelatory, and unlike anything the guitarist has done in his legendary career.</p><p>&quotWhen the time comes to make a record, I&#8217ve either got something pressing to say or I haven&#8217t,&quot says Clapton. &quotIf I haven&#8217t, I&#8217ll create some subterfuge&#8212but then something interesting comes in underneath, and those have often been the most significant albums for me. Unplugged was a bit like that. On this one I thought, we might as well just have some fun. There was no calculation, it was all just what came to the surface. And I feel that on the album.&quot</p><p>In the years since his last album, 2005&#39s Back Home, Clapton has been involved in numerous projects with other musicians, including a 2006 album with Cale, The Road to Escondido, and historic tours alongside Steve Winwood (documented on the Grammy-nominated Live at Madison Square Garden album) and Jeff Beck. This spirit continued on CLAPTON  starting with co-producer/guitarist Doyle Bramhall II and a remarkable core of other musicians&#8212drummer Jim Keltner, bassist Willie Weeks, and keyboardist Walt Richmond&#8212the sessions later added guests including Winwood, Cale, Wynton Marsalis, Sheryl Crow, Allen Toussaint, and Derek Trucks.</p><p>&quotThe album was made over three states and two countries,&quot says Bramhall. &quotIt was a chance to live out a musical dream, and it was a very prolific time. We just let the music dictate where we were going.&quot</p><p>Clapton&#39s affinity for the blues has, of course, defined much of his musical life, from his early days with the Yardbirds and John Mayall&#39s Bluesbreakers to his recent work playing with B.B. King and revisiting the songs of Robert Johnson. Less familiar, though, is the impact of rollicking jazz numbers and intimate pop standards that inform CLAPTON.</p><p>&quotI never liked young kids&#39 music,&quot he says. &quotI like old people&#8217s music. When I look for what I&#8217m going to listen to, I go backwards. Most people are trying to figure out, &#39How do I get in the fast lane, going that way?&#39 I&#8217m going in the other direction&#8212I want to find the oldest thing to do.&quot</p><p>At age 65, after more than four decades as one of the world&#39s premier guitarists, Eric Clapton approaches these songs with familiarity and comfort, and finds a way to bring Texas bluesman Little Son Jackson&#39s &quotTraveling Alone,&quot JJ Cale&#39s &quotRiver Runs Deep,&quot and a moving, hushed &quotHow Deep is the Ocean&quot under one roof. When he described the album to guitarist/musicologist Ry Cooder, Cooder said, &quotYou can&#39t do that, it&#39ll give people whiplash!&quot (Clapton says with a laugh that after that discussion, he flirted with titling the album Whiplash.)</p><p>&quotA song like &#39Autumn Leaves&#39 is about where we are in our lives, really,&quot he says. &quotWe play rock &amp roll and blues and all that, but at the end of the day, we&#8217re all balladeers. That song opened the door for all kinds of possibilities. Nothing is too schmaltzy, because if you play it right, with a little bit of funk, it can work. If someone likes it, great, and if they don&#8217t, fine&#8212it&#8217s me I have to entertain at the end of the day.&quot</p><p>Midway through the recording of CLAPTON, Clapton had a medical emergency and was rushed into surgery. While he was recovering, he had a musical vision that added yet another element to the album&#39s unexpected mix. &quotWhile Eric was in the hospital, these two Fats Waller songs popped into his head,&quot says Bramhall. &quotSo he thought he should probably record them, because it must have meant something.&quot</p><p>Bramhall contacted New Orleans eminence Allen Toussaint, an authority on the virtuoso composer and comedian Waller. The resulting recordings of &quotMy Very Good Friend The Milkman&quot and &quotWhen Somebody Thinks You&#39re Wonderful&quot feature two pianos, trumpet solos from jazz giant Marsalis, and a classic Crescent City horn section including Trombone Shorty and Dr. Michael White of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band.</p><p>Though this Dixieland style resembles nothing we&#39ve heard from Clapton before, he notes that the tests presented by the vast musical scope of CLAPTON are issues he has been confronting throughout his career. &quotThe challenge with these things has always been the same for me,&quot he says. &quotHow do you take, say, a Skip James song and transfer it to a contemporary blues, or rock, setting? The deliberate choice of who I play with is because I know and I trust what they&#8217re going to do, and they bring something to it that nobody else can bring.&quot</p><p>It seems significant that this album is the guitarist&#39s first studio effort since the 2007 publication of his best-selling autobiography, also titled Clapton. Following the introspection required by that project, the disc&#39s fourteen songs play like the musical memoir of an incredible journey. It&#39s telling, too, that Clapton says he recorded the album with a very specific audience in his mind.</p><p>&quotWhen I&#8217m on stage,&quot he says, &quotI need to focus on someone, not just me, so I find someone&#8212it might be my wife, or one of my daughters, or a friend who I haven&#8217t seen for a long time. When I was making this record, I was thinking about my grandmother a lot, and my mother and my uncle. Those were the three chief influences in my life, and those were the people I was singing to, really.&quot</p><p>Having tackled the material on CLAPTON, this master musician now seems most excited about the possibilities of what comes next. After starting this project on a whim, Eric Clapton found himself pursuing so many unexpected new directions that he sounds like a kid, exhilarated by the simple pleasures of making music just for the fun of it.</p><p>&quotThere&#39s no limit for what I can attempt to do,&quot he says. &quotI think the next thing I&#8217d like to do is to play some Latin stuff, or else go into that New Orleans jazz thing. That intrigues me, because what I do will fit in there&#8212I can play electric guitar as if it were with Louis Armstrong and the Hot Five. Wouldn&#8217t that be great?&quot</p>', 1977, NULL),
(128, 'Buddy Guy', '<p>After decades of paying dues, Buddy Guy has emerged as the most heralded bluesman of his generation, a hugely influential guitarist and passionate, dynamic live performer. But Buddy started as a sideman, and toiled in the Chicago clubs for a decade before beginning his march to worldwide fame.</p><p>Buddy began as a sideman in Baton Rouge, playing primarily with the late Raful Neal (father of bluesman Kenny Neal and an excellent bluesman in his own right). Seeking a record deal, Buddy came to Chicago in 1957 at the age of 21. He was &#8220adopted&#8221 by Muddy Waters, who encouraged the young bluesman when gigs weren&#8217t immediately forthcoming. Buddy&#8217s first step forward was winning a legendary guitar contest at the Blue Flame on the South Side, when his combination of great playing and showmanship (his 100-foot guitar cord allowing him to wander through the audience and down the street).</p><p>He quickly won a local reputation for his wild live shows, in the style of his first big influence, Guitar Slim. Later Buddy absorbed the smoother sounds of B.B. King, but Buddy&#8217s tortured, high-pitched, gospel-influenced vocal style put him in a different category he simply couldn&#8217t (and wouldn&#8217t) control the frenzy of his music.</p><p>He found his first recording contract with Eli Toscano&#8217s Artistic label (Eli also owned the Cobra label, which broke Magic Sam and Otis Rush as major league blues stars in the 1950s). His two singles for Artistic were produced by Willie Dixon, but they failed to dent the charts. When Cobra folded, Buddy was signed by Chess where he continued his association with Dixon. His Chess singles like &#8220The First Time I Met The Blues,&#8221 &#8220Let Me Love You, Baby,&#8221 &#8220My Time After Awhile&#8221 and &#8220Stone Crazy&#8221 are now considered classics that first exhibited Buddy&#8217s mature style, with his stuttering guitar work and on-the-edge singing. But again, Buddy didn&#8217t receive the R&ampB radio play of his contemporaries, and he continued to work the South Side clubs as well as doing session work for Chess with Muddy Waters, Koko Taylor and others.</p><p>When the folk music boom of the 1960s began turning its attention to electric blues, Buddy finally found his audience. Pairing with his friend, harpist Junior Wells (with whom he had played for many years at Theresa&#8217s Lounge), he recorded first on Junior&#8217s classic HOODOO MAN BLUES album on Delmark and then on Vanguard&#8217s CHICAGO/THE BLUES/TODAY series, which was one of the first blues recordings aimed at the young folk audience. Buddy won a contract with Vanguard, cutting his famed A MAN AND THE BLUES album. He hit the road, appearing with both Junior and on his own, electrifying folk and rock venues and touring the U.S., Europe and Africa (including a tour with the Rolling Stones). Eric Clapton named Buddy as his favorite guitarist.</p><p>But even with all this fame and hundreds of live shows, Buddy couldn&#8217t secure a major label contract during the &#821670s and &#821680s. He recorded extensively for English and European labels, both in the studio and live. His brilliant electric and acoustic (with Junior Wells) albums for the French Isabel label were issued in the U.S. by Alligator under the titles STONE CRAZY! and ALONE &amp ACOUSTIC.</p><p>Finally, in the 1990s, Buddy got the break he was looking for. He was signed to the Silvertone label (distributed by the multinational BMG) and his fans Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck joined him for his DAMN RIGHT I&#8217VE GOT THE BLUES CD. The album along with the accompanying video launched Buddy as a headliner, playing not only blues festivals but also major rock venues. He hasn&#8217t looked back since then, cutting album after album of passionate, hard-edged blues and rock tunes, often with guest appearances by rockers. More recently, he&#8217s recorded stripped-down CDs that have taken him back to his Deep South roots.</p><p>When not on the road, Buddy spends most of his time at his famous Buddy Guy&#8217s Legends club, easily the top blues spot in Chicago, if not the world.</p>', 1999, NULL),

Jalapeno-hot!&quot<br/>-- Los Angeles Times</p><p>&quotBreathtaking, hardcore roadhouse rhythm &amp blues.&quot<br/>--Rolling Stone</p><p>Delbert McClinton proudly defies classifications. His music blends his Texas roots with roadhouse rock, juke-joint blues, Memphis soul and country. During his entire recording career, record labels have consistently tried to pigeonhole Delbert&#39s music. But if you ask the critics about Delbert&#39s dynamic vocals and harmonica style, you&#39ll hear descriptions ranging from &#39honky-tonk,&#39 &#39blue-eyed soul,&#39 and &#39Texas stomp&#39 to &#39country rock&#39 and &#39blues.&#39 Delbert&#39s music rebels against traditional categorization. Ask Delbert what kind of music he plays and he&#39ll say, &quotFun music.&quot</p><p>Delbert was born in Lubbock, Texas in 1940 and moved to Ft. Worth at the age of 12. His mother was a beautician and his father a switchman for the Rock Island Railroad, the same famous &quotRock Island Line&quot that was the subject of so many songs by Texas bluesmen. But Delbert was growing up as a normal Texas teenager, unaware of the blues, until (as he recalled in MUSICIAN magazine) one fateful day. &quotI was coming back from squirrel hunting and there was this old black barbecue place, and I heard Joe Turner&#39s &quotHoney Hush.&quot The closer I got, the more excited I got. My heart went to pounding, and I said, &#39Who is that, and what is it?&#39 I&#39ll never forget that. There&#39s no way I can explain it. I just went nuts. That stuff still does it to me. Boy, I wish I could hear more music that could do that to me now.&quot Delbert began to immerse himself in the local R&ampB scene, staying up into the early morning, listening to KNOK, Ft. Worth&#39s R&ampB station. He formed his first band, The Mellow Fellows, with a bunch of eager, though not very talented, teenagers. They played anywhere, anytime just for the experience.</p><p>In the years that followed, Delbert played in a number of bands including The Straightjackets, the house band for an all-black blues club south of Ft. Worth. While in that group, Delbert got to back visiting blues greats like Howlin&#39 Wolf, Jimmy Reed, Bobby &quotBlue&quot Bland and Sonny Boy Williamson.</p><p>By the late 1950s, Delbert had begun to build a name for himself around Ft. Worth. In 1960 he became the first white artist to have a record played on KNOK. The song, a cover version of Sonny Boy Williamson&#39s &#8220Wake Up Baby&#8221 was released on the Le Cam label. Delbert also played harmonica on Bruce Channel&#39s 1962 hit, &#8220Hey, Baby,&#8221 which soared to the top of the national pop charts. Channel took Delbert with him on a tour of England where Channel&#39s opening act was a young band called The Beatles. Between shows, Delbert taught an eager John Lennon some harmonica lines (which you&#39ll hear if you listen to &#8220Hey Baby&#8221 and &#8220Love Me Do&#8221 back to back).</p><p>After returning from England, Delbert formed a group called the Ron-Dels which recorded for a number of labels and scored a national hit with Delbert&#39s &#8220If You Really Want Me To I&#39ll Go.&#8221 The song was later recorded by Waylon Jennings and Doug Sahm. But it was as a performer, not a recording artist, that Delbert found his real fame. He played virtually every roadhouse in Texas, rocking the night away from behind chicken wire screens and earning a loyal following of fans.</p><p>In 1972, Delbert moved to Los Angeles and teamed up with an old Texas pal named Glen Clark to form a country-rock band called Delbert and Glen. The group recorded a couple of albums for Clean Records, a low-budget affiliate of Atlantic. The albums didn&#39t sell well, but Delbert&#39s songwriting talent began to turn some heads.</p><p>Returning to Ft. Worth in 1974, Delbert landed a solo contract with ABC Records, who released three albums, VICTIM OF LIFE&#39S CIRCUMSTANCES, GENUINE COWHIDE and LOVE RUSTLER, between 1975 and 1977. ABC tried to market Delbert&#39s music within the &#39progressive country&#39 movement, but the label didn&#39t quite fit. In fact, Delbert&#39s ABC albums blended steel guitar and fiddles with soulful horns and funky rhythms, predating the roots-rock/country sound of the 1980s by a decade. The albums received critical acclaim but never found a market, and Delbert and ABC parted company. In 1986, Alligator Records released, HONKY TONKIN&#39 (I DONE ME SOME), an anthology album featuring the best cuts from Delbert&#39s ABC albums. (The album is now out of print because Alligator couldn&#39t license CD rights from ABC).</p><p>Despite the difficulty Delbert had with his own record sales, his songwriting continued to draw attention. In 1978, Emmylou Harris had a number one country hit with Delbert&#39s &#8220Two More Bottles Of Wine,&#8221 and in 1980, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd included another McClinton original, &#8220B Movie Boxcar Blues,&#8221 on their hit album BRIEFCASE FULL OF BLUES.</p><p>After leaving ABC, Delbert signed a deal with Capricorn Records, the home of the &#39southern rock&#39 sound of The Allman Brothers, The Marshall Tucker Band, Elvin Bishop and The Charlie Daniels Band. Two more critically acclaimed recordings were made: &#8220Second Wind&#8221 in 1978 and &#8220Keeper Of The Flame&#8221 in 1979. When Capricorn folded at the end of the 1970s Delbert signed with Muscle Shoals Sound (distributed by Capitol) and recorded THE JEALOUS KIND. With the help of a top ten single, &#8220Giving It Up For Your Love,&#8221 the album became Delbert&#39s first real hit, making both the country and pop charts. THE JEALOUS KIND was followed by PLAIN FROM THE HEART, but by that time Muscle Shoals Sound was already closing up shop, and the album wasn&#39t effectively promoted.</p><p>After the Muscle Shoals albums, Delbert took a leave of absence from recording, although he continued to deliver powerful live performances, averaging nearly 200 dates a year. In 1986, guitarist Roy Buchanan invited Delbert to be the special guest vocalist on Roy&#39s second Alligator album, DANCING ON THE EDGE. Delbert&#39s contribution to that album received accolades from his fans and the media alike. One of Delbert&#39s two vocal tracks, an update of Bo Diddley&#39s &#8220You Can&#39t Judge A Book By The Cover,&#8221 was deemed strong enough to be released by Alligator as one of the label&#39s rare singles.</p><p>LIVE FROM AUSTIN, Delbert&#39s 1989 Alligator release, was his first live album ever and his first new album - at the time - in nine years. Featuring Delbert&#39s road band plug three additional horns, the album was recorded as the soundtrack for AUSTIN CITY LIMITS, the nationally syndicated public television show. Delbert hand picked all of the material on the album from almost ninety minutes of live performance and included five of his own originals. He also flew into Chicago to supervise remixing the tracks along with Alligator president Bruce Iglauer. LIVE FROM AUSTIN was nominated for a Grammy for &quotBest Contemporary Blues Album.&quot</p><p>In 1992, McClinton won a Grammy for his duet with Bonnie Raitt for the song &#8220Good Man/Good Woman&#8221 from Raitt&#39s album LUCK OF THE DRAW. The next year, another duet with Tanya Tucker, &#8220Tell Me About It,&#8221 was nominated for a CMA award. A second Top 10 hit, &#8220Everytime I Roll the Dice&#8221, emerged from Delbert&#39s 1992 album NEVER BEEN ROCKED ENOUGH.</p><p>But the 1990s were marked by a long and frustrating association with Curb Records which only ended when McClinton re-emerged with a star-studded comeback, 1997&#39s ONE OF THE FORTUNATE FEW, on the since-defunct Rising Tide label.<br/>During that period, McClinton moved to Nashville and, along with writing partner Gary Nicholson, became one of the most sought-after tunesmiths in Music City. In recent years, his songs have been featured on albums by Vince Gill, Wynonna, Lee Roy Parnell, Martina McBride, and others. There&#39s been a lot of what Delbert calls &quotmailbox money&quot coming in lately.</p><p>His 2001 album, NOTHING PERSONAL, released on the New West label, has proven the most popular album of his career.  It spent months on BILLBOARD&#39S Blues Chart, won him national TV appearances and brought his career, after 40 years on the road, to a new peak.</p>', 1997, NULL),
(132, 'Kem', '<p>Universal Motown Records singer-songwriter-producer KEM has announced that he will release his third album, Intimacy, preceded by a series of online promotional videos that will reintroduce him to the marketplace by offering an intimate preview of what&#8217s to come. The new CD is the Detroit native&#8217s long awaited follow-up to his critically acclaimed and certified gold 2005 disc, KEM Album II.</p><p>Intimacy was inspired by KEM&#8217s deeply personal lessons on intimacy and it will allow fans to experience him unlike ever before musically, lyrically, and visually. For the first time in his career, KEM will lay all of his cards on the table and grant fans the opportunity to get up close and personal while delivering a 10-song collection of timeless music for the grown and sexy.</p><p>Intimacy features vocal and production collaborations with the likes of Grammy-winning soul diva Jill Scott and the late Motown legend David J. Van dePitt, who famously produced Marvin Gaye&#8217s 1971 masterpiece, What&#8217s Going On. Scott delivers enchanting verses of spoken word in &#8220Golden Days,&#8221 while Van dePitt arranged the Detroit Symphony Orchestra&#8217s string section on the first single, a gorgeous ballad called &#8220Why Would You Stay.&#8221 Los Angeles producer Rex Rideout (Luther Vandross, Angie Stone) also joined KEM in the studio to help round out the Intimacy listening experience. The result is a richer sound buttressed by classical instruments and a greater range of musical styles that will certainly expand KEM&#8217s audience by garnering success across multiple formats, including pop, R&ampB, and urban adult contemporary.</p><p>The first online video to be released offers a revealing behind the scenes look of the making of a promotional commercial for the new album that was filmed at the MGM Grand in Detroit. The second clip will be the actual promotional commercial, which depicts a night in the life of KEM, partying with friends at Detroit&#8217s MGM Grand and breaking out in an impromptu performance at the club. It serves as a formal introduction of the new album and KEM&#8217s understanding of intimacy. &#8220The moment you realize you&#8217re not alone is your finest hour,&#8221 he says at the start of the commercial. &#8220When you can finally allow yourself to be seen as you truly are&#8212that&#8217s what intimacy is to me.&#8221</p><p>Smooth grooves, powerful vocals, heartfelt lyrics, and just plain feel-good music best describe KEM&#8217s instantly recognizable sound. In 2002, the self-taught musician wrote and produced his critically acclaimed debut solo album, Kemistry, which spawned the hit single &#8220Love Calls.&#8221 The classic track went on to break records for longevity on the Urban A/C chart while the disc achieved gold-plus status and solidified KEM&#8217s position as a leading man in the world of jazz-influenced R&ampB music. The success of his gold certified follow-up CD, 2005&#8217s KEM Album II&#8212which debuted at an impressive No. 5 on Billboard&#8217s all-important Top 200 Chart&#8212proved KEM&#8217s staying power in the very competitive world of R&ampB.</p><p>Now with the release of Intimacy, KEM is opening up to reveal the elusive man behind the voice. In fact, working on this project not only led KEM, a proud father of two daughters who self-produced his first two albums, to a deeper understanding of the true meaning of intimacy, but it also helped him achieve a greater appreciation for the significance of intimacy in all aspects of his life beyond romantic relationships. &#8220I&#8217ve spent the past five years working on this project in the midst of many personal trials, which caused me to pause and take a more introspective look at myself, my family relationships, my walk with God, and even how I relate to my music,&#8221 said KEM. &#8220What I found was that giving each more time and attention is essential.&#8221</p>', 2003, NULL),

The experiments that resulted filled the studio hard drive with diverse, abstract sounds. Amorphous echoes, cacophonous samples, and handmade staccato merged into wandering, elusive melody. Each track felt like a hallucination.</p><p>We didn&#39t know if any of those unorthodox ideas could be incorporated into a traditional album, but we knew we didn&#39t want our next album to be predictable. Sitting together in the same studio where we made our first album, all six of us voiced a commitment to going out on a limb, to making something truly daring. We asked ourselves: were we all earnestly willing, more than ever before, to abandon the precepts of commercial ambition in pursuit of what we believe to be honest art?</p><p>The inclination to begin writing conventional songs for a conventional album came and went. The temptation to adjust our creative vision to fulfill expectations beyond our studio walls yielded to the audacious ambition of what he hoped to achieve as a band. The two years of making A Thousand Suns marked our exhilarating, surrealistic, and often challenging journey into the creative unknown.</p><p>On the eve of its completion, this body of work, assembled through unconscious inspiration and unmitigated exertion, has revealed to us notions both stirring and surprising.  The imagery personified herein is neither dogma nor political premeditation.  The emergent themes and metaphors illuminate a uniquely human story.</p><p>Oppenheimer&#39s words resonate today not only for their historical significance, but for their emotional gravity.  So, too, A Thousand Suns grapples with the personal cycle of pride, destruction, and regret.  In life, like in dreams, this sequence is not always linear.  And, sometimes, true remorse penetrates the devastating cycle.  The hope, of course, springs from the notion that the possibility of change is born in our most harrowing moments.</p><p>Enjoy the music.</p><p>Linkin Park</p>', 2000, NULL),
(140, 'Lil Wayne', '<p>With well over ten millions in sales, unquestionable street credibility, critical acclaim, industry accolades, eight Grammy nominations, and four Grammy wins for his multi-platinum selling album The Carter III, Cash Money/Universal Motown recording artist Lil Wayne has firmly laid to rest all doubt that he is anything less than the best rapper alive today. Wayne&#8217s silky flow, along with his uncanny ability to weave incredible metaphors and similes wrapped in taunt rhymes accented by witty punch lines, compel rap fans around the world to hang onto his every word whenever his records are being played.</p><p>Now with his highly anticipated release Rebirth, the CEO of Young Money Entertainment (YME) is once again poised to take the world by storm. As the album&#8217s title suggests, Rebirth is all about change and transformation and it represents Lil Wayne&#8217s development as a man and as an artist. &#8220On this album I want to show my growth as an artist,&#8221 says Wayne. &#8220I want my fans to see how far I have come musically.&#8221</p><p>Born Michael Dewayne Carter, Jr. and raised in New Orleans&#8217 infamous Hollygrove neighborhood, Lil Wayne started his stellar career at age 12 when a friend introduced him to Cash Money Co-CEOs and brothers Ronald &#8220Slim&#8221 Williams and Bryan &#8220Birdman&#8221 Williams. Spotting his potential right off the bat, Birdman took the talented pre-teen under his wing and began grooming him for superstardom.</p><p>In 1993, Lil Wayne formed a duo with label mate B.G. and released an underground EP called True Stories. The record served as a perfect introduction to the game for Lil Wayne. Even then, he proved he had the skills to be a major player, but there was more in store for the young MC. In 1997, Lil Wayne and B.G. formed the southern super group Hot Boys with Juvenile and Turk and released the quartet&#8217s debut album, Get It How You Live, which not only sold over 500,000 units independently, but also convinced Universal Records to ink a lucrative distribution deal with Cash Money Records.</p><p>Wayne&#8217s star continued to rise with stellar verses on Cash Money albums such as the Big Tymers&#8217 How You Love That (1998), Juvenile&#8217s multi-platinum 400 Degrees, and Hot Boys&#8217 Guerilla Warfare. In 1999, Lil Wayne scored a No. 1 single with the title track from his solo debut album, The Block is Hot, which sold over two million units. From there, Wayne never looked back. The following year he released his platinum sophomore effort, Lights Out, followed by 500 Degrees two years later.</p><p>Then Wayne kicked his career into overdrive with the critically acclaimed Tha Carter series. Tha Carter (2004) earned Lil Wayne another platinum plaque and placed him among an elite class of hip-hop lyricists. Tha Carter II (2006) further solidified his status as one of the best MCs in the hip-hop game. But it was the critically-acclaimed Tha Carter III (2008) that gave him his iconic stature in popular music while making hip-hop history by selling one million copies in one week. The album also garnered Lil Wayne eight Grammy nominations and four Grammy wins.</p><p>Lil Wayne&#8217s seventh album, Rebirth raises the artistic bar to unprecedented heights and promises to take him to even greater levels of success. It is without a doubt some of his best work to date, boasting production by some of by some of today&#8217s hottest producers, namely Infamous (Lil Wayne, Plies, LL Cool J), Cool &amp Dre, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, and Chase N Cashe (Flo-Rida, Pussycat Dolls). Guest appearances include Eminem (&#8220Drop the World&#8221), Cash Money multi-platinum rock star Kevin Rudolf (&#8220One Way Trip&#8221), and &#8220The Ladies of Young Money Entertainment&#8221 &#8212 Nicki Minaj (&#8220Knockout&#8221) and Shanell (&#8220American Star,&#8221 &#8220Prom Queen,&#8221 &#8220Running,&#8221 &#8220I&#8217m So Over You&#8221). Musically, Rebirth melds innovative rhymes with complex melodies accented by deep bass lines and touches of rock, reggae, and &#821780s pop, giving listeners the kind of unexpected twists and turns that make for a great album.</p><p>Highlights include the intoxicating Cool &amp Dre-produced lead single, &#8220On Fire,&#8221 which brings together the spirit of &#821780s pop with a hypnotic Miami bass-inspired beat. It is a record that will heat up the airwaves while sending fans rushing to dance floors across the globe. &#8220Prom Queen&#8221 is another standout track. Produced by Infamous, the song brings together elements of rock and hip-hop in a way that doesn&#8217t compromise the integrity of either genre. &#8220I have evolved both lyrically and musically as an artist and I want everyone to hear my growing pains,&#8221 says Wayne. &#8220This is probably my best work yet.&quot</p><p>Buttressed by stellar production combined with Lil Wayne&#8217s seamless flow, distinct vocals, outstanding lyrics, plus his willingness to break new musical ground, Rebirth will no doubt be ranked among the finest albums of 2010.</p>', 1999, NULL),
(141, 'Nicki Minaj', '<p>Any encounter with Nicki Minaj will arouse a heightened sense that there is more to her than meets the eye and inspire the desire to experience this modern day &quotWonder Woman&quot Nicki Minaj - the name alone appeals to the decadence within us all. Whoever thinks that you can&#39t &quothave your cake and eat it too&quot has obviously not met Nicki. The surname Minaj is the metaphor which underscores Nicki&#39s empowerment to have it all and do it all! This 25 year old native of Jamaica, New York (Queens, Southside) is also a trained and accomplished writer, singer, actress and hip hop artist. Her &quotWonder Woman&quot characteristics are embodied in the three facets of Nicki Minaj. The three elements that comprise this modern day &quotWonder Woman&quot are Nicki the Ninja, Nicki the Harajuku Barbie and Nicki the Boss. Nicki the Ninja is a hip hop lyrical assassin, which is sometimes naughty. Nicki the Harajuku Barbie accentuates the qualities of an imaginative, fun, coquettish girly girl- fashionista...that loves all things pink. This is also the muse who ignites the transformation of Nicki&#39s performances as an R&ampB/Pop singer and future Rock Star Icon. Nicki the Boss- the ingenious austere business woman that always thinks outside of the box. Most importantly, this boss lady is never afraid to assert herself.<br/>Career</p><p>Nicki honed her innate ability and star potential at the renowned school of performing arts which was denoted in the movie and television series FAME. It was not long before she began to attract the attention of local producers and hip hop artist in the rap genre. Reluctant at first to cast herself, as a rapper her apprehension was predicated on the thought that the industry would attempt to limit her to one thing when she knew that she was so much more. Decidedly, Nicki accepted the challenge and embarked on the journey of a female emcee in a hip hop world dominated by males.</p><p>It was not long before her lyrical skills were sought after by the likes of Lil&#39 Wayne. Nicki was determined not to befall the ill-fate of so many other talented female rappers. Instead she opted to qualify her lyrical skills through the ranks of the underground mix tape circuit. Success was inevitably achieved with her critically acclaimed performance credit on the DVD entitled &quotThe Come Up&quot and mixtapes like Playtime is Over, the infamous Sucka Free, and Beam Me Up Scotty. Now in demand Nicki&#39s role expands as a featured artist and female persona of Lil Wayne&#39s record label Young Money Entertainment. In addition, she has a worked with celebrated recording artists Mariah Carey, Gucci Mane, Drake, Usher, Bobby Valentino, Ludacris, Robin Thicke, Jadakiss and Sean Garrett.</p><p>The evolution of Nicki Minaj continues as she exploits her talents as a singer and explores her passion as a writer. Nicki is currently, in the studio recording her first album (due out in Fall 2010) which will feature some R&ampB and Pop songs. Of equal importance, she is also engaged in writing new materials for herself and other artists. Nicki is also considering several acting roles. Nicki is the previous winner of the Underground Music Awards (UMA) female artist of the year and past Southern Entertainment Awards (SEA) female mix tape artist of the year nominee.</p><p>Follow Nicki on Twitter! @NICKIMINAJ</p><p>Read more: http://www.myspace.com/nickiminaj#ixzz114KJzwKk</p>', 2010, NULL),

The pleasure that I derive from my work and my accomplishments make everything worth it. When I began conceptualizing the new album, these three words stuck in my head. They completely infiltrated my creative process, so it was inevitable that they became the album title.&#8220</p><p>&#8220PASSION, PAIN &amp PLEASURE&quot is Songz&#8217 hugely anticipated follow-up to 2009&#8217s RIAA gold-certified smash, &#8220READY.&#8221 From the bouncy first single, &#8220Bottoms Up (Feat.

As ever, Trey displays effortless vocal dexterity while simultaneously relaying complex emotional depth and power. The throbbing, minimalist &#8220Can&#8217t Be Friends&#8221 and the classic R&ampB romance of &#8220Please Return My Call&#8221 reveal reflective and introspective themes of love and human relations, stressing the sensual above the overtly sexual.</p><p>&#8220This is the album where I talk to the people who think all I can sing about is sex,&#8221 says Songz. &#8220I take a step further out of that realm, although I do keep one foot in.&#8221</p><p>&#8220PASSION, PAIN &amp PLEASURE&#8221 marks Songz&#8217 first new release since making the transition from rapidly rising young artist to bonafide R&ampB superstar. &#8220READY&#8221 was a true breakthrough, giving Trey his first-ever Billboard 200 Top Ten debut on its way to RIAA gold certification.

An unqualified ratings sensation, the 10-part BET documentary provided an exclusive window into Songz&#8217 life and career, chronicling everything up to and including the making of the new album.</p><p>The late, great Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun once declared Trey to be &#8220among the most promising R&ampB artists we have had on Atlantic since we started the company 60 years ago.&#8221  That promise long fulfilled, &#8220PASSION, PAIN &amp PLEASURE&#8221 now confidently confirms Trey Songz&#8217 rightful place at the very forefront of contemporary urban music.</p><p>&#8220I&#8217ve had three albums before this, but only one was really a hit,&#8221 he says. &#8220This album will show that I&#8217m not going anywhere.&#8221</p>', 2007, NULL);

They went back overseas the following month when they were invited out by N*E*R*D*.</p><p>It is FM&#8217s stage energy and the &#8216Free Wired&#8217 lifestyle that started to change the way people reacted to their music. Not just the energy and lifestyle, but fashion and technology play a huge part. &#8220We&#8217ve played at every club in southern Cali and thrown parties, &#8216geekin out&#8217 at friends lofts and rooftops in downtown LA until the sun came up.&#8221 &#8220Our routine and fashion allow us to party all night, then head straight to an important business meeting in the morning, we always stay business fresh, plus we keep shades on to hide the lack of sleep,&#8221 jokes Prohgress.</p><p>It was at those all-night parties that the group honed their sound and performance skills.  &#8220We felt like when we started messing more with hard electro synths, 4 to the floor drums and upbeat Daft Punk-type production it just seemed to connect better with the type of performance we do,&#8221 Prohgress said. &#8220And once we had &#8216Girls On The Dance Floor&#8217 that was just like the bazooka ammunition that we needed.&#8221</p><p>&#8220Girls On The Dance Floor&#8221 became an undeniable, high-energy track that prompted women from all over to record videos of themselves dancing to the song and upload the clips online.  The song exploded the latter part of 2009 in nightclubs and topped the playlists in L.A. The requests and heavy rotation earned Far East Movement a spot on a prestigious L.A. concert headlined by Jay-Z.</p><p>The follow up record &#8220Like A G6&#8221 received an even more rabid reaction from listeners. &#8220That one had over a million hits on YouTube before it even had one play on the radio,&#8221 Kev Nish said about the song they put together in two hours with Los Angeles producers The Cataracs.</p><p>Free Wired, the album, captures the hypnotic, electronic energy of earlier hits &#8220Girls On The Dance Floor&#8221 and &#8220Like A G6&#8221, but also encompasses a slower-paced, &#821680s dance, pop and tribal sound.</p><p>Snoop Dogg guests on the bombastic &#8220If I Was You&#8221 where you don&#8217t hear a typical Snoop, but hear him singing and integrating himself into the FM sound. There&#8217s also the mid-tempo dance floor track, for all the dance crews that love FM, called &#8220So What&#8221 that samples a group that with a huge influence, The Beastie Boys&#8217 and their smash &#8220So What&#8217cha Want&#8221.</p><p>Lil&#8217 Jon gets amped on the soon to be club banger &#8220Go Ape.&#8221  While recording &#8220Go Ape&#8221 with their resident producers, the Grammy nominated Stereotypes, Lil&#8217 Jon was suggested for the track due to its crunk influence.

They were influenced by the thriving downtown LA scene and a wide array of music from fellow West Coast classics like the Pharcyde and Dr Dre, to the dance music of DJ Tiesto and Daft Punk, to LA rockers like Guns N Roses, Linkin Park and Blink 182. &#8220Our musical inspiration is as large as what we can hold on our iPods.&#8221</p><p>After graduating from high school the group started taking music more seriously, doing shows wherever they could at Los Angeles bars, clubs and lofts. One of their earlier shows was a successful benefit show that raised money for a drug rehab center that helped a lot of their friends in the community. This came before the group even had their first song recorded.  The group loved to perform and perfect their stage presence wherever they could.</p><p>&#8220Another big part of our movement is how we stay connected to the fans ourselves,&#8221 states J-Splif. &#8220They demanding our songs on radio and at the clubs, so we&#8217re always listening and try to give back.  We used to go to a club and watch all night just to see how the crowd would react to certain songs the DJ played and soak it in.&#8221 &#8221It&#39s important that we translate to everyone what we&#8217re about on this album,&#8221 Kev Nish added. &#8220We want people to feel free to &#39geek out&#39 however they feel comfortable and stay wired with us whether partying or home online. Live Free and Stay Wired is where is stems from.&#8221</p><p>Another influence came when they saw Kanye West live and the kind of performance he achieved. &#8220I remember we saw a Kanye show,&#8221 Prohgress said. &#8220He threw a towel into the audience and people were fighting for it. We wanted to give that type of energy.&#8221  &#8220It&#8217s always been about that energy and that lifestyle at our shows.&#8221</p><p>You already might be familiar with Far East Movement&#8217s music unknowingly as they also receive placements that are as impressive as artists who have already reached superstar status. &#8220Girls On The Dance Floor&#8221 was featured in a major scene in the hit film Get Him To The Greek, MTV&#8217s America&#8217s Best Dance Crew season 4 finale, CBS&#8217 CSI Miami, and FOX&#8217s So You Think You Can Dance.</p><p>Their music has also been heard on television hits Gossip Girl, Entourage, ABC Family&#8217s Lincoln Heights, 2009 Miss America pageant and in the blockbuster film and video game &#8220Fast and Furious&#8221.

(144, 'Quincy Jones', '<p>Quincy Jones<br/>MUSICIAN, COMPOSER, PRODUCER, ARRANGER, CONDUCTOR<br/>Biography</p><p>An impresario in the broadest and most creative sense of the word, Quincy Jones&#39 career has encompassed the roles of composer, record producer, artist, film producer, arranger, conductor, instrumentalist, TV producer, record company executive, magazine founder, multi-media entrepreneur and humanitarian. As a master inventor of musical hybrids, he has shuffled pop, soul, hip-hop, jazz, classical, African and Brazilian music into many dazzling fusions, traversing virtually every medium, including records, live performance, movies and television.</p><p>Celebrating more than 60 years performing and being involved in music, Quincy&#39s creative magic has spanned over six decades, beginning with the music of the post-swing era and continuing through today&#39s high-technology, international multi-media hybrids. In the mid-50&#39s, he was the first popular conductor-arranger to record with a Fender bass. His theme from the hit TV series Ironside was the first synthesizer-based pop theme song. As the first black composer to be embraced by the Hollywood establishment in the 60&#39s, he helped refresh movie music with badly needed infusions of jazz and soul. His landmark 1989 album, Back On The Block--named &quotAlbum Of The Year&quot at the 1990 Grammy Awards-- brought such legends as Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Miles Davis together with Ice T, Big Daddy Kane and Melle Mel to create the first fusion of the be bop and hip hop musical traditions while his 1993 recording of the critically acclaimed Miles and Quincy Live At Montreux, featured Quincy conducting Miles Davis&#39 live performance of the historic Gil Evans arrangements from the Miles Ahead, Porgy and Bess and Sketches of Spain sessions, garnered a Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance. As producer and conductor of the historic &quotWe Are The World&quot recording (the best-selling single of all time) and Michael Jackson&#39s multi-platinum solo albums, Off The Wall, Bad and Thriller (the best selling album of all time, with over 50 million copies sold), Quincy Jones stands as one of the most successful and admired creative artist/executives in the entertainment world.</p><p>His 1995 recording, Q&#39s Jook Joint, again showcased Quincy&#39s ability to mold the unique talents of an eclectic group of singers and musicians, in what resulted in a retrospective of his broad and diverse career from that of a seasoned Jazz musician, to skilled composer, arranger, and bandleader, to acclaimed record producer.</p><p>A reference to the backwoods club houses of rural America in the 1930&#39s, 40&#39s, and 50&#39s, the platinum selling Q&#39s Jook Joint featured performances by artists such as Bono, Brandy, Ray Charles, Phil Collins, Coolio, Kenny &quotBabyface&quot Edmonds, Gloria Estefan, Rachelle Ferrell, Aaron Hall, Herbie Hancock, Heavy D., Ron Isley, Chaka Khan, R. Kelly, Queen Latifah, Tone Loc, the Luniz, Brian McKnight, Melle Mel, Shaquille O&#39Neal, Joshua Redman, the Broadway musical troupe Stomp, SWV, Take 6, newcomer Tamia, Toots Thielemans, Mervyn Warren, Barry White, Warren Wiebe, Charlie Wilson, Nancy Wilson, Stevie Wonder, Mr. X, and Yo-Yo, among others, and garnered seven Grammy nominations.  His recording, From Q, With Love, featured a collection of 26 love songs that he recorded over the last 32 years of his more than 50 year career in the music business.</p><p>Named by Time Magazine as one of the most influential jazz musicians of the 20th century, Quincy Jones was born on March 14, 1933, in Chicago and brought up in Seattle. While in junior high school, he began studying trumpet and sang in a gospel quartet at age 12. His musical studies continued at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he remained until the opportunity arose to tour with Lionel Hampton&#39s band as a trumpeter, arranger and sometime-pianist. He moved on to New York and the musical &quotbig leagues&quot in 1951, where his reputation as an arranger grew. By the mid-50&#39s, he was arranging and recording for such diverse artists as Sarah Vaughan, Ray Charles, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Big Maybelle, Dinah Washington, Cannonball Adderly and LeVern Baker.</p><p>In 1957, Quincy decided to continue his musical education by studying with Nadia Boulanger, the legendary Parisian tutor to American expatriate composers such as Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copeland. To subsidize his studies he took a job with Barclay Disques, Mercury&#39s French distributor. Among the artists he recorded in Europe were Charles Aznavour, Jacques Brel and Henri Salvador, as well as such visitors from America as Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine and Andy Williams. Quincy&#39s love affair with European audiences continues through the present: in 1991, he began a continuing association with the Montreux Jazz and World Music Festival, which he serves as co-producer.</p><p>Quincy won the first of his many Grammy&#8217s in 1963 for his Count Basie arrangement of &quotI Can&#39t Stop Loving You.&quot Quincy&#39s three-year musical association as conductor and arranger with Frank Sinatra in the mid-60&#39s also teamed him with Basie for the classic Sinatra At The Sands, containing the famous arrangement of &quotFly Me To The Moon,&quot the first recording played by astronaut Buzz Aldrin when he landed upon the moon&#39s surface in 1969.</p><p>When he became vice-president at Mercury Records in 1961, Quincy became the first high-level black executive of an established major record company. Toward the end of his association with the label, Quincy turned his attention to another musical area that had been closed to blacks--the world of film scores. In 1963, he started work on the music for Sidney Lumet&#39s The Pawnbroker and it was the first of his 33 major motion picture scores. In 1985, he co-produced Steven Spielberg&#39s adaptation of Alice Walker&#39s The Color Purple, which garnered eleven Oscar nominations, introduced Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey to film audiences, and marked Quincy&#39s debut as a film producer. In 1991 Quincy helped launch NBC-TV&#39s hit series, The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air, for which he served as an executive producer.</p><p>In 1990, Quincy Jones formed Quincy Jones Entertainment (QJE), a co-venture with Time Warner, Inc. The new company, which Quincy served as CEO and chairman, had a broad ranging, multi-media agenda which encompassed programming for current and future technologies, including theatrical motion pictures and network, cable and syndicated television. QJE produced NBC Television&#39s Fresh Prince Of Bel Air (now in syndication), and UPN&#39s In The House and Fox Television&#39s Mad TV, among other syndicated shows and television specials.  In 1991 Jones founded VIBE Magazine, and with his publishing group VIBE Ventures, would go on to acquire SPIN and Blaze Magazines before divesting his magazine interests.</p><p>In January 1992, Quincy Jones executive produced the An American Reunion concert at Lincoln Memorial, an all-star concert and celebration that was the first official event of the presidential inaugural celebration and drew widespread acclaim as an HBO telecast.</p><p>On March 25, 1996, Quincy Jones, executive produced the most watched awards show in the world, the 68th Annual Academy Awards.  The show received widespread acclaim as one of the most memorable Academy Award shows in recent years.</p><p>In 1997, Quincy Jones formed the Quincy Jones Media Group.  QJMG&#8217s feature film projects in development include such highly anticipated films as the adaptations of the Ralph Ellison novel Juneteeth, David Halberstam&#8217s The Children for Home Box Office in association with producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, a bio-pic on the 19th century Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, Pimp and Seeds of Peace for Showtime, among others.  For television, QJMG is developing the sit-com The White Guy.  QJMG is also active in live entertainment, direct response marketing, and cross-media projects for home entertainment and educational applications.  Along with Harvard University and MicroSoft, Jones produced the complete encyclopedia of African and African-American culture, Encarta Africana.</p><p>As a record company executive, Quincy remained highly active in the recording field throughout the 1990s as the guiding force behind his own Qwest Records, which boasted such important artists as New Order, Tevin Campbell, Andre Crouch, Gregory Jefferson and Justin Warfield. New Order&#39s album, Substance earned Qwest a gold album in 1987. Tevin Campbell&#39s T.E.V.I.N was both a critical sensation and major commercial success, and the label&#39s release of the Boyz N The Hood soundtrack album was among the most successful soundtrack recordings of 1991. Qwest Records has also released soundtrack albums from the major motion pictures Sarafina! and Malcolm X.</p><p>In 1994, Quincy Jones led a group of businessmen, including Hall of Fame football player Willie Davis, television producer Don Cornelius, television journalist Geraldo Rivera and businesswoman Sonia Gonsalves Salzman in the formation of Qwest Broadcasting, a minority controlled broadcasting company which purchased television stations in Atlanta and New Orleans for approximately $167 million, establishing it as one of the largest minority owned broadcasting companies in the United States.  Quincy served as chairman and CEO of Qwest Broadcasting.  In 1999, taking advantage of the rapid escalation of broadcast station values, Jones and his partners sold Qwest Broadcasting for a reported $270 million.</p><p>The laurels, awards and accolades have been innumerable: Quincy has won an Emmy Award for his score of the of the opening episode of the landmark TV miniseries, Roots, seven Oscar nominations, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&#39 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, 27 Grammy Awards, and N.A.R.A.S.&#39 prestigious Trustees&#39 Award and The Grammy Living Legend Award. He is the all-time most nominated Grammy artist with a total of 79 Grammy nominations. In 1990, France recognized Quincy with its most distinguished title, the Commandeur de la Legion d&#39 Honneur. He is also the recipient of the French Ministry of Culture&#39s Distinguished Arts and Letters Award. Quincy is the recipient of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music&#39s coveted Polar Music Prize, and the Republic of Italy&#39s Rudolph Valentino Award.  He is also the recipient of honorary doctorates from Howard University, the Berklee College of Music, Seattle University, Wesleyan University, Brandeis University, Loyola University (New Orleans), Clark Atlanta University, Claremont University&#39s Graduate School, the University of Connecticut, Harvard University, Tuskegee University, New York University, University of Miami and The American Film Institute, among others.  In 2001, Jones was named a Kennedy Center Honoree, for his contributions to the cultural fabric of the United States of America and most recently was recognized by the National Endowment for the Arts as a Jazz Master, the nation&#8217s highest jazz honor.</p><p>In 1990, his life and career were chronicled in the critically acclaimed Warner Bros. film, Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones, produced by Courtney Sale Ross, a film which helped illuminate not only Quincy&#39s life and spirit, but also revealed much about the development of the African American musical tradition. Reflecting on the changes in pop music over the years, Quincy says, &quotIf there are any common denominators, they are spirit and musicality. I go for the music that gives me goose bumps, music that touches my heart and my soul.&quot Over the years, Quincy Jones has reached the essence of music and art: the ability to touch people&#39s feelings and emotions.</p><p>In 2001, Quincy Jones added the title &#8220Best Selling Author&#8221 to his list of accomplishments when his autobiography &#8220Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones&#8221 entered the New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal Best-Sellers lists.  Released by Doubleday Publishing, the critically acclaimed biography retells Jones&#8217 life story from his days as an impoverished youth on the Southside of Chicago through a massively impressive career in music, film and television where he worked beside legends such as Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald and Michael Jackson, among many others.  In conjunction with the autobiography, Rhino Records released a 4-cd boxed set of Jones&#8217 music, spanning his more than 5 decade career in the music business, entitled &#8220Q: The Musical Biography of Quincy Jones.&#8221</p><p>The audio recording of &#8220Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones,&#8221 (Simon &amp Schuster) earned Jones his 27th Grammy Award, in the Best Spoken Word Category, while &#8220Q: The Musical Biography of Quincy Jones&#8221 garnered him a 15th NAACP Image Award, in the category of Outstanding Jazz Artist.</p><p>In 2008 &#8220The Complete Quincy Jones: My Journey &amp Passions, (Palace Press) examined the virtuosity of the man Frank Sinatra named &#8220Q,&#8221 celebrating his prolific contribution to American art and culture. The book included a foreword by Clint Eastwood, preface from Bono, an introduction by Maya Angelou and an afterword by Sidney Poitier.  Comprised of personal interviews and recollections from Jones, this collection peers behind the veil of celebrity, with extraordinary access to his creative inspirations and achievements.</p><p>Jones next projects include the forthcoming release of Soul Bossa Nostra, an album featuring some of today&#8217s biggest recording artists and producers such as Usher, Ludacris, Akon, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Hudson, Mary J. Blige, T-Pain, Robin Thicke, LL Cool J, John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Wyclef Jean, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Three 6 Mafia, David Banner, Bebe Winans, Mervyn Warren, Jermaine Dupri, DJ Paul, and Scott Storch, among others, who have joined together to celebrate the music of the multi-Grammy winning producer, composer and arranger by recording contemporary versions of popular recordings from his massive catalog the book &#8220Q on Producing&#8221 which recounts his six-decade long career working in the recording studio with music icons such as Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, among many others a duets album with Stevie Wonder and Tony Bennett as well as multiple projects for film and television.</p><p>With a long history of humanitarian work which began in the 1960&#8217s and 70&#8217s, Jones was one of the key supporters of Jesse Jackson&#8217s Operation P.U.S.H.  In 1985, he pioneered the model of using celebrity to raise money and awareness for a cause with &#8220We Are the World.&#8221  The song remains the best-selling single of all-time, and raised more than $63 Million for Ethiopian famine relief.  More importantly, however, it shined a spotlight on the Ethiopian drought and U.S. Government responded with over $800 million in aid.</p><p>In 1999 Quincy Jones joined Bono and Bob Geldof during a meeting with Pope John Paul II as a part of the Jubilee 2000 delegation to end third world debt.  The delegation&#8217s visit resulted in $27 billion in third world debt relief for Bolivia, Mozambique, and the Ivory Coast.</p><p>In 2004, in front of a live audience of more than a half-million spectators, Jones launched the We Are the Future initiative with a concert featuring Carlos Santana, Alicia Keyes, Josh Groban, Oprah Winfrey, Norah Jones and a host of other entertainers from around the world.  The initiative has established Municipal Child Centers in the cities of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Asmara (Eritrea), Freetown (Sierra Leone), Kigali (Rwanda) and Nablus (Palestine) where youth are being trained to run child-based programs in health, nutrition, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Sports and Arts.</p><p>In 2007, Jones and the Harvard School of Public Health joined forces to advance the health and well-being of children worldwide through Project Q, a strategic initiative of School&#8217s Center for Health Communication.  Through the strategic use of media, Project Q challenges leaders and citizens of the world to provide essential resources to enable young people to achieve their full potential.</p><p>A centerpiece of Project Q is the Q Prize, which recognizes extraordinary leadership by public figures and social entrepreneurs who are championing the needs of children.  The inaugural Q Prize was awarded in January 2007 to Scott Neeson, founder of the Cambodian Children&#8217s Fund, and over $600,000 was raised in support of Neeson&#8217s work.  The 2008 Q Prize will be awarded on October 23 in New York City.</p><p>Through his personal foundation, The Quincy Jones Foundation, Jones raises awareness and financial resources for initiatives that support global children&#8217s issues in areas of conflict, malaria eradication, clean water and efforts to restore the Gulf Coast (post-Katrina). Philanthropic partners include Malaria No More, Millennium Promise, and R&ampB singer Usher&#8217s New Look Foundation.</p>', 1989, NULL),
(145, 'Nelly', '<p>By now the story of Grammy-winning, multiplatinum hip-hop superstar-actor-entrepreneur-philanthropist Nelly&#8217s meteoric rise to stardom is a well-known, oft-recited part of hip-hop history. The standout member of the St. Louis rap collective the St. Lunatics inks a deal with Universal Motown Records, drops a sizzling single called &#8220Country Grammar&#8221 with a familiar nursery rhyme hook, and follows it up with a debut album of the same name that spawns three humongous hits, spends seven weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart, scores three Grammy nominations, and sells an astonishing 9 million copies worldwide.</p><p>That, of course, is the abridged version of a story that began years ago in a part of St. Louis known as University City. It&#8217s the story of a young man whose life was so unsettled that he moved from place to place, from family member to family member, and hung out on the streets where he was introduced to the underbelly of the city. But Nelly&#8217s is also a story of achievement&#8212overachievement, even. As a child, Nelly, born Cornell Haynes, Jr., was always the fastest runner, the best catcher, the hottest player on the team. He was so gifted, in fact, that he almost ended up in professional baseball instead of music.</p><p>Much to the delight of the legions of fans that now rank him among hip-hop&#8217s premier artists, Nelly charged onto the hip-hop scene in the summer of 2000 with his breakthrough debut CD, Country Grammar. The critical acclaim, accolades, and awards rolled in almost as fast as the record sales. Country Grammar snagged three Grammy nominations, two for Best Rap Solo Performance (&#8220Ride Wit Me,&#8221 &#8220Country Grammar&#8221) and one for Best Rap Album (Country Grammar). Nelly also topped Billboard&#8217s 2000 year-end chart as the Top Male Rap Artist, and he was nominated for an American Music Award, an MTV Video Music Award, two BET Awards, two Source Awards, and a Soul Train Music Award.</p><p>Two years later, in the summer of 2002, Nelly proved to be no one-hit wonder when his sophomore album, Nellyville, entered the Billboard 200 chart at No. 1. Boasting the popular favorite &#8220Pimp Juice,&#8221 Nellyville went on to sell more than 6 million units and win two Grammy Awards for the ubiquitous hit singles &#8220Hot In Herre&#8221 (Best Male Rap Solo) and &#8220Dilemma,&#8221 featuring Kelly Rowland (Best Rap/Sung Collaboration). Nellyville also earned two American Music Awards, a Nickelodeon Kids&#8217 Choice Award, and two Soul Train Music Awards, in addition to pushing Nelly to No. 1 on Billboard&#8217s 2002 year-end charts as the Top Pop, Rap, and R&ampB/Hip-Hop Artist. And as a featured artist on &#8220Where The Party At&#8221 by Jagged Edge, Nelly scored an additional 2002 Grammy nomination for Best Rap/Song Collaboration.</p><p>Following the phenomenal success of 2000&#8217s 9X platinum Country Grammar and 2002&#8217s 6X platinum Nellyville, Nelly released a platinum-selling remix album in 2003 called Da Derrty Versions (The Reinvention). The star-studded album not only showcased innovative renditions of Nelly&#8217s signature hits remixed by the hottest producers in the game, including The Neptunes, Jermaine Dupri, David Banner, and Scott Storch, but it also features guest appearances by the likes of Justin Timberlake, Usher, Ron Isley, and Brian McKnight. That same year, Nelly contributed a track called &#8220Shake Ya Tailfeather,&#8221 featuring Murphy Lee and P. Diddy, to the Bad Boys II soundtrack. An overnight sensation, &#8220Shake Ya Tailfeather&#8221 topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, scored a 2004 MTV Video Music Award (Best Hip-Hop Video), and won Nelly his third Grammy Award (Best R&ampB Performance by a Duo or Group).</p><p>2003 was an incredibly busy year for Nelly. Beyond music, he launched a women&#8217s clothing company called Apple Bottoms, a men&#8217s clothing line called Vokal, and an energy drink called Pimp Juice, as well as partnering with Nike to release a limited edition sneaker called the Air Derrty. In an effort to educate African-Americans and other minorities about the need for bone marrow and stem cell transplant donations, and to register more donors, Nelly launched the Jes Us 4 Jackie foundation in March 2003 with his late sister, Jackie Donahue, after she was diagnosed with leukemia.</p><p>With the simultaneous release of his 2004 albums, Sweat and Suit, Nelly became the first solo artist and the first hip-hop artist in history to debut at No. 1 and No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart. The platinum-selling Sweat was conceived as an upbeat party album, packed with infectious club jams such as &#8220Flap Your Wings&#8221 and &#8220Tilt Ya Head Back,&#8221 featuring Christina Aguilera while the 3X platinum Suit is made up of smooth, melodic hits like &#8220My Place,&#8221 featuring Jaheim, and the crossover country smash &#8220Over and Over,&#8221 featuring Tim McGraw, which scored a 2005 CMT Music Awards nomination for Collaborative Video of the Year.</p><p>While Sweat and Suit were still riding high on the charts, Nelly dropped the gold-certified 2005 compilation, Sweatsuit, featuring all of the No. 1 hits that made Sweat and Suit instant classics, along with three new singles: &#8220Tired,&#8221 featuring Derrty Ent. artist Avery Storm &#8220Nasty Girl,&#8221 featuring Diddy, The Notorious B.I.G., Jagged Edge, and Avery Storm and the Jermaine Dupri-produced smash &#8220Grillz,&#8221 featuring Paul Wall, Ali, and Gipp. That same year, Nelly landed a supporting actor role alongside Adam Sandler and Chris Rock in the film The Longest Yard, which earned him a 2005 Teen Choice Award for Choice Rap Artist in a Movie.</p><p>Sadly, tragedy struck in 2005 when Nelly&#8217s sister Jackie Donahue lost her battle with leukemia. But while Nelly&#8217s Jes Us 4 Jackie foundation was unable to find a bone marrow donor for his sister, he remains passionately committed to the fight against cancer. To date, nine lives have been saved by the Jes Us 4 Jackie foundation&#8217s efforts to match bone marrow donors.</p><p>Following a three-year hiatus, Nelly resurfaced in 2008 with his fifth album, Brass Knuckles. Propelled by the lead single &#8220Party People,&#8221 featuring Fergie and produced by Polow Da Don, Brass Knuckles debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. Other highlights from the album included &#8220Body On Me,&#8221 featuring Akon and Ashanti, and &#8220Stepped On My J&#8217z,&#8221 featuring Jermaine Dupri and Ciara. During that time, Nelly also expanded his acting resume by appearing in a recurring role on the hit CBS series CSI: NY from 2008-2009.</p><p>In August 2010, Nelly made a powerful return to the Billboard charts with &#8220Just a Dream,&#8221 the platinum lead single from his sixth album, 5.0, to be released by Universal Motown Records on November 16. Co-produced by Jim Jonsin and Rico Love, &#8220Just a Dream&#8221 soared to No. 1 on iTunes&#8217 Top Hip-Hop/Rap Songs chart, No. 2 on Billboard&#8217s Ringtones chart, No. 3 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard&#8217s Digital Songs chart, and No. 4 on Billboard&#8217s Pop Songs chart. Just as fast as &#8220Just a Dream&#8221 became the best-selling digital single of Nelly&#8217s career, the song&#8217s music video swiftly surpassed more than 15 million views on VEVO, proving to be a dazzling testament to Nelly&#8217s extraordinary mass appeal.</p><p>5.0 finds Nelly stacking the deck with the hottest producers and guest artists in pop music (T.I., T-Pain, Akon, Birdman, Keri Hilson, Kelly Rowland, Dr. Luke, Bangladesh, Rico Love, Jim Jonsin, Polow Da Don).

I learned to play guitar when I was twelve fro m this guy named Ronnie who came over to fix my parents&#39 computer. I like quilts. But that&#39s probably because I&#39m always freezing cold. I LOVE Nashville. That&#39s where I live, when I&#39m lucky enough to be there. I love the town so much, I sometimes feel like I should just roll the windows down in my car (nicknamed the Toyoat. Because it&#39s a Toyota) and scream &quotI LOVE THIS TOWN&quot loudly out the windows. That wouldn&#39t be weird, right? Every time I try and wink at someone, I mess it up and end up scaring people. My lucky number always has been and always will be 13. It pops up in front of me in the most obvious and undeniable ways, but only when something good is about to happen. I&#39m a Sagittarius. I think that means I&#39m always looking for something new. It also means I have a Christmas-themed birthday party every year. I love bright colors and things that make reality seem more whimsical than it is. I have a collection of ribbons and headbands, and I love them all the same.

I&#39ve been like this since I was a baby, before I was gigantically tall and over-talkative.</p><p>These days, I&#39ve been trying to classify my thoughts into two categories: &quotThings I can change,&quot and &quotThings I can&#39t.&quot It seems to help me sort through what to really stress about. But there I go again, over-planning and over-organizing my over-thinking! I write songs about my adventures and misadventures, most of which concern love. Love is a tricky business. But if it wasn&#39t, I wouldn&#39t be so enthralled with it. Lately I&#39ve come to a wonderful realization that makes me even more fascinated by it: I have no idea what I&#39m doing when it comes to love. No one does! There&#39s no pattern to it, except that it happens to all of us, of course. I can&#39t plan for it. I can&#39t predict how it&#39ll end up. Because love is unpredictable and it&#39s frustrating and it&#39s tragic and it&#39s beautiful. And even though there&#39s no way to feel like I&#39m an expert at it, it&#39s worth writing songs about -- more than anything else I&#39ve ever experienced in my life.</p><p>I&#39ve apparently been the victim of growing up, which apparently happens to all of us at one point or another. It&#39s been going on for quite some time now, without me knowing it. I&#39ve found that growing up can mean a lot of things. For me, it doesn&#39t mean I should become somebody completely new and stop loving the things I used to love. It means I&#39ve just added more things to my list. Like for example, I&#39m still beyond obsessed with the winter season and I still start putting up strings of lights in September. I still love sparkles and grocery shopping and really old cats that are only nice to you half the time. I still love writing in my journal and wearing dresses all the time and staring at chandeliers. But some new things I&#39ve fallen in love with -- mismatched everything. Mismatched chairs, mismatched colors, mismatched personalities. I love spraying perfumes I used to wear when I was in high school. It brings me back to the days of trying to get a close parking spot at school, trying to get noticed by soccer players, and trying to figure out how to avoid doing or saying anything uncool, and wishing every minute of every day that one day maybe I&#39d get a chance to win a Grammy. Or something crazy and out of reach like that. ) I love old buildings with the paint chipping off the walls and my dad&#39s stories about college. I love the freedom of living alone, but I also love things that make me feel seven again. Back then naivety was the norm and skepticism was a foreign language, and I just think every once in a while you need fries and a chocolate milkshake and your mom. I love picking up a cookbook and closing my eyes and opening it to a random page, then attempting to make that recipe. I&#39ve loved my fans from the very first day, but they&#39ve said things and done things recently that make me feel like they&#39re my friends -- more now than ever before. I&#39ll never go a day without thinking about our memories together.</p><p>For the last two years, I&#39ve been writing and recording an album called Speak Now. I only have the option of writing about things that happen in my life, so thankfully a LOT has happened in my life in the last two years. I know I don&#39t always say the right thing at the right time or speak up when I should, but I write it all down. I get my guitar and a pen and all of a sudden, I have a chance to say exactly what I meant to say in real life. Some of the things I wrote about are things everyone saw me go through. Some of the things I wrote about are things nobody ever knew about. I&#39m beyond excited for you to hear these stories and confessions.</p><p>I think it&#39s important that you know that I will never change. But I&#39ll never stay the same either. Must be a Sagittarius thing.</p><p>I&#39m pretty stoked that you read this whole thing. I commend you for that. This was ridiculously long, and you probably have other stuff you could&#39ve done in the last four minutes. So to you, or anyone else who has spent four minutes on me in some way-- listening to just one song, or watching one of my videos&#8230.Thank you. I love you like I love sparkles and having the last word. And that&#39s real love.</p><p>--Taylor</p>', 2007, NULL);

(159, 'Josh Groban', '<p>With his flawless lyrical baritone, Josh Groban is known around the world as a classically influenced pop singer.  Groban first broke through in 2001 with his self-titled 5x-platinum self-titled debut, followed by 2003&#39s 5x-platinum Closer and 2006&#39s 2x-platinum Awake. In 2007, Groban became the best-selling recording artist of the year thanks to sales of Awake and his blockbuster 5x-platinum Christmas album, No&#235l, which spent five consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. Groban and his recordings have been nominated for more than a dozen awards including an American Music Award, a World Music Award, a Juno Award, two Grammy Awards, and an Academy Award for &quotBelieve&quot from the 2005 film Polar Express. He has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide.</p><p>It seems no one knew what to expect when Josh Groban teamed with super-producer Rick Rubin for the singer&#8217s fifth album, Illuminations &#8211 least of all Groban and Rubin. Fittingly, the results both defy and exceed any possible expectations as each of the collaborators stepped out of his zone and together they created an entirely new zone, one where folk meets classical, where art meets intimacy, where immediacy meets timelessness and where, most importantly, Groban was free to express himself more fully, more truly than ever before.<br/>&#8220These are my stories,&#8221 says Groban, who co-wrote 11 of the 13 songs on the collection, complemented by personalized if surprising selections written by Nick Cave and the poignant mother-son collaboration by Kate McGarrigle and Rufus Wainwright. &#8220Every one of these songs, someone&#8217s going to know it&#8217s about them. I&#8217m going to get a text message about every one! This is a very personal record.&#8221</p><p>Groban had certainly never made a record like this before. But then neither had Rubin, whose nonpareil career runs from the early days of rap with Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys through the hard-edged rock of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Metallica to Johnny Cash&#8217s latter-day life-embracing American Recordings series. What the combination brought out was a new range of expression and emotional connection from Groban, music that taps into generations of Americana and reaches across the oceans and lyrics drawn straight from the heart. In the course of the album, we see aspects of Groban unknown in the acclaimed stretch since he first stepped into the spotlight as a teenager, beyond even the personality and wit he flashed in his much-shared Emmy Awards medley and his noted guest role in last season&#8217s Glee finale. The words he offers in &#8220Hidden Away&#8221 could almost address the mission of the album itself:</p><p>Sing it out<br/>So I can finally breathe in<br/>I can take it all the same<br/>Reaching out for someone I believe in<br/>All I really need today</p><p>Illuminations was three years in the making, but the writing and recording came in bursts of creativity, maximizing the spontaneity and personal touch. Groban teamed with singer-songwriter Dan Wilson (former leader of the band Semisonic and co-writer of several pieces on the Dixie Chicks&#8217 Not Ready to Make Nice including the 2007 Grammy song of the year title track) on most of the songs. Most of the recordings were done live in a casual setting with Groban playing piano and singing alongside acoustic guitarists Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel and, on some songs, iconic organist Spooner Oldham. From those sessions, orchestrations were crafted by David Campbell for nine songs and James Newton-Howard for two, while Brazilian great Carlinhos Brown created the dynamic setting for &#8220Voce Existe Em Mim (You Exist In Me)&#8221 in his Bahia home, including the power of an all-girl drum corps &#8211 the only drums on the album.</p><p>The partnership of Rubin and Groban developed organically and out of deep mutual respect. After an exploratory meeting, both were eager to take on a full album project.</p><p>&#8220From Day 1 it wasn&#8217t about anything to prove, but two people finding a place to work together &#8211 two scared people,&#8221 Groban quips. &#8220We wanted to find our line &#8230 and walk past it. This from Rick&#8217s view was to be a fine art record. That grandness was something we wanted to embrace. We started out thinking we&#8217d do a little folkie record. We wanted the looseness of that, the rawness of an intimate folk record and the power and warmth of a classical record.&#8221<br/>Rubin right from the start challenged Groban to tap deeper into his full range of talents than he had before, as a singer, musician and, crucially, a writer.</p><p>&#8220Rick picked a few songs he liked for me and said, &#8216Beat these.&#8217&#8221 Groban recalls. &#8220He said he&#8217d be fine making a covers record with me, but if I wanted to do something special I should write songs that speak for me. So I went into a hole and wrote feverishly. I didn&#8217t try to better the classics he gave me, but wrote songs that were more me.&#8221</p><p>The song &#8220Hidden Away&#8221 is a prime example of how this took shape. With the core band&#8217s tracks recorded all in one take &#8211 Groban&#8217s vocals included &#8211 it mixes intimate warmth and grandeur. The opening piano chords and the unfolding melody evoke a timeless Americana, a thread from Stephen Foster through Aaron Copland through Paul Simon and Randy Newman, as Groban makes a heartfelt plea not to hide true love or one&#8217s true self.</p><p>That and the other Groban-Wilson teamings came very naturally, bringing the best out of each&#8217s talents. Generally they&#8217d sit one day to come up with the melody and musical ideas, with a few lyrical ideas sketched out. Then after sleeping on it a night, they&#8217d reconvene to finish the words and fill out the music.  &#8220My strength is melody,&#8221 Groban says. &#8220And his is helping find lyrics that don&#8217t sound trite on the melody.&#8221</p><p>For &#8220Love Only Knows,&#8221 Rubin heard Groban&#8217s piano and voice rendition and then instructed the guitarists to adapt the piano part for the introduction. The result is almost folk-Bach beauty, joined soon by the piano and voice, with swelling strings (recorded at the famed Capitol Records studio) following to bring a lush sweep to the song. Again, the core band was recorded live, vocals and all &#8211 this time despite Groban being a bit under the weather.  &#8220Rick said, &#8216We can always redo it,&#8217 but he had the microphone set so I could sing and play,&#8221 Groban says. &#8220And we used it!&#8221  Again, it brings a very personal, human touch to the words, powerful lines of yearning to live and love fully and honestly.</p><p>&#8220Voce Existe Em Mim (You Exist In Me)&#8221 brought Groban into new territory, not just for the contributions of Brazilian lyricist Lester Mendez (with whom he&#8217d worked when duetting on Nelly Furtado&#8217s Spanish-language album) and superstar arranger Brown, but for the language.  &#8220I&#8217d never sung in Portuguese,&#8221 he says, noting that he loved the sensuous tones of the tongue.   Brown&#8217s drum troupe gives the song a vivid exuberance and blends with Campbell&#8217s glissando strings for a joyous, intercontinental celebration.</p><p>For &#8220L&#8217Ora Del Addio (Farewell Time),&#8221 Groban ventures into more familiar linguistic territory, showing off the Italian chops familiar to fans. The song&#8217s a musical collaboration with veteran Walter Afanasieff (his partner for &#8220Per Te&#8221 on the Closer album) with lyrics by Italian songwriter Marco Marinangeli. It brings back the romantic, operative approach Groban&#8217s been known for, but with some new aspects.  &#8220Rick&#8217s assignment was to come up with that classical vibe,&#8221 he says. &#8220I&#8217d take my right hand and play melodies, and Walter&#8217s ability to come up with these Rachmaninoff type chords to them was uncanny. There was a side to Rick that wanted us to take on these big, soaring melodies.&#8221</p><p>Bringing it back home, but no less exotic, is &#8220Bells of New York City,&#8221 a love ballad to the Big Apple &#8211 where Californian Groban has set up his new home. The song started with a simple piano improvisation that Wilson loved and helped nurture into a full musical cityscape with dramatic strings and percussion (including, yes, bells) and a tone that hints at the Irish and other cultures that have made New York everything it is.<br/>The choice of Nick Cave&#8217s &#8220Straight to You&#8221 may seem a strange one to some, and Groban &#8211 a long-time Cave fan &#8211 was a bit skeptical at first as to whether it was a good fit. But again he credits Rubin&#8217s vision in shaping the arrangement of the yearning lyrics and moving melody in what proved to be a perfect match of singer and song.</p><p>&#8220Au Jardin Des Sans Pourquoi&#8221 came from Groban&#8217s friendship with Rufus Wainwright. When the idea of Wainwright contributing a song came up, he asked Groban if it would be okay if it was something he&#8217d written with his mother, Kate McGarrigle, one of the most cherished folk-pop singer-songwriters of modern music. After sending Groban the song, Wainwright revealed that it was the first time he had ever co-written with his mother &#8211 and it proved to be the only time, as McGarrigle passed away last year from cancer. For Groban, an already poignant song (the title means &#8220The Garden Without Why&#8217s&#8221) became a moving tribute to his friend and his beloved, talented mother.</p><p>Giving the album another facet are two musical interludes, including &#8220The Wandering Kind,&#8221 which Groban wrote when he was all of 12 years old.  &#8220I don&#8217t know where this came from when I was 12,&#8221 he says, of the piece, a waltz that runs through some crazy modulations. &#8220But I always liked it. I played it for Rick and said, &#8216I can&#8217t make a song of this. It&#8217s all over the place. Can we do an instrumental?&#8217&#8221</p><p>With cello, stand-up bass, mandolin, acoustic guitar, accordion and Groban&#8217s piano breezily underscores the pan-cultural American sweep of the album, as well as the deeply personal accomplishment this represents &#8211 a little aside marking a true achievement for a growing artist.</p><p>&#8220I was given the very lofty task of having more responsibility on this album than I&#8217ve ever had,&#8221 he says. &#8220The bar was set high from the beginning. That&#8217s why it took so long. But I can say that more of me went into this record than anything I&#8217ve done.&#8221</p>', 2003, NULL),

(164, 'Kid Rock', '<p>Rock N Roll Jesus is Kid Rock&#8217s most honest, eclectic, and soulful record to date.  It&#8217s his State of the Union address, a deeply personal statement that looks at racism in America, empathizes with soldiers in Iraq (Rock visited the troops last Christmas) and also lays bare his tormented relationship with Pam Anderson.  During their breakup, Rock assumed a low profile, focusing on his music for the first time in years.  Initially, he teamed up with producer Rick Rubin, who gave him a much-needed jolt of confidence.  &#8220I told him, &#8216there are no classic American rockers right now, none,&#8217&#8221 says Rubin.  &#8220&#8217You can fill that gap.  There&#8217s no competition, just get in there and do it.&#8217&#8221  Rubin also encouraged Rock to step up his lyrics.  &#8220I said, &#8216Don&#8217t say your name in every song.  You already covered all that &#8220I&#8217m Kid Rock, suck my dick, let&#8217s get drunk&#8221 shit.&#8217&#8221  Rock immediately wrote what he considers his best song ever, &#8220Amen,&#8221 in which he points his middle finger at &#8220scumbag lawyers and wolves-in-sheep&#8217s-clothing pastors.&#8221  &#8220When I played that for Rick, I was like, &#8216How about this motherfucker?&#8217&#8221 Rock says.  &#8220He said, &#8216You fuckin&#8217 nailed it!&#8221</p><p>By February, when Rock had recovered from the hangover of his divorce, he teamed up with another producer, Rob Cavallo (best known for Green Day&#8217s American Idiot), back in Rock&#8217s Michigan studio.  &#8220From there, I could do no wrong,&#8221 he says.  &#8220I was just on fire.&#8221  Without sounding forced or contrived, the songs on Rock N Roll Jesus glide through Rock&#8217s favorite musical genres:  country, rock, punk, and hip-hop.  &#8220All Summer Long&#8221 is as evocative of an adolescent romance in Michigan as Bob Seger&#8217s &#8220Night Moves.&#8221  Cuts like &#8220New Orleans&#8221 and &#8220Don&#8217t Tell Me U Love Me&#8221 draw on the classic rock and country he heard at his parents&#8217 parties.  Rock uses his trademark lyrical boasts sparingly, saving up for lines like &#8220I fuck hot pussy until it&#8217s cold&#8221 and &#8220I take strippers out to breakfast.&#8221</p><p>It helps that Rock is filthy rich, having sold more than 20 million records on top of lucrative touring and merchandising revenues.  He owns a house in Malibu, a three-story condo in West Nashville, and a thirty-acre spread in the Detroit suburb of Clarkston, Michigan, which is home base for Rock&#8217s fourteen-year-old son, Bobby Junior.  The place is like a rock-and-roll theme park, featuring dirt bike and go-cart tracks, basketball and tennis courts, recording studios, a man-made lake and two swimming pools.  The property&#8217s many garages house custom motorcycles and a Dukes of Hazzard golf cart, as well as Rock&#8217s limited-edition Ford GT race car, and his latest indulgence, a white V16 1930 Cadillac gem that cost more than half a mil.</p><p>Whatever you want to call him &#8211 Rock &amp Roll Jesus, the Detroit Cowboy, American Badass, the Early Morning Stoned Pimp, or just plain Bobby, as he&#8217s known to his friends and family &#8211 Robert James Ritchie was born on Superbowl Sunday 1971.  &#8220He came in two ounces shy of ten pounds out of his hundred-pound mama,&#8221 says his dad, Bill Ritchie, on the deck of his lakefront Michigan home.  &#8220He wanted to be a big deal right from the get-go.&#8221  Financially speaking, Bill Ritchie was a big deal himself, the overlord of two Lincoln-Mercury dealerships, and a tour of Kid Rock&#8217s childhood home in the town of Romeo debunks any lingering myths that he grew up in a double-wide.</p><p>In his Mercury SUV, Bill and I ride from the lake to the 8,000-square-foot home, which is painted white and sits on a hill overlooking a pool and tennis court on land that was formerly an apple orchard.  Bobby was the third of four children:  older sister Carol handles Rock&#8217s books his straight-laced younger sister, Jill, is an actress (she played Charisma in Herbie Fully Loaded) who lives in Los Angeles Rock&#8217s older brother, Billy, who lost his right leg at age six in a tractor accident, has struggled with drug addictions and is now studying to be a yoga instructor.  As a child, despite his injury, Billy played football and was a competitive skier.  Local TV news channels documented Billy&#8217s struggle, and a full-page article on him appeared in the Detroit News.  &#8220All the attention was always on my brother,&#8221 says Rock.  &#8220He&#8217d be on That&#8217s Incredible! &#8211 because he was incredible.  But that&#8217s why I&#8217m such a show-off.&#8221</p><p>Bill Ritchie leads me to a barn next to the house, where he and his wife, Susan, Rock&#8217s mom, used to throw parties every Friday night.  &#8220This is a big part of Bob&#8217s history,&#8221 he says.  Ritchie &#8211 who sometimes refers to himself as Daddy Rock &#8211 is a dominating presence with a wicked sense of humor.  At one point during the conversation, he took a leak off the side of the porch.  Ritchie doesn&#8217t look much like his son, but the two obviously have a lot in common &#8211 including a predilection for partying.  &#8220The apple doesn&#8217t fall too far from the tree,&#8221 says Mrs. Ritchie, pointing at her husband of forty-three years.</p><p>&#8220I was one of those guys that worked sixty, seventy hours a week, and when Friday came, we let loose,&#8221 says Bill.  &#8220I built this party room and I was the disc jockey, and I&#8217d blast Sixties rock &amp roll.  I&#8217d blast heavy country-western:  Johnny Cash, Waylon, Hank Jr., Merle Haggard.  I blasted the shit out of it!&#8221  If the neighbors complained about the noise, Rock&#8217s dad would tell them, &#8220You&#8217re not supposed to sleep!  Get up and come to the party!&#8221  The barn also became a venue for Rock&#8217s first performances, when he was about six.  &#8220He stood there,&#8221 his dad says proudly, pointing to the top of the bar,  &#8220with his little cowboy boots on and a fake guitar, singing &#8216Bad, Bad Leroy Brown.&#8217&#8221</p><p>When Rock was a kid, his father put him to work, planting trees around their property and mowing their massive lawn.  For spending cash, Rock would gather apples in a nearby orchard for thirty-five cents a bushel.  His father&#8217s favorite mantra is &#8220any idiot can earn a dollar, it takes a genius to spend a penny,&#8221 but Rock resented his father&#8217s tightfisted grip on the family finances.  To this day, nothing pleases Rock more than to wind up his father with tales of exorbitant purchases, like the massive Civil War cannon that greets visitors at Rock&#8217s Clarkson estate.  &#8220I told my dad that the guy wanted $70,000 for it, but he was such a cool motherfucker, I gave him seventy-five,&#8221 Rock says.  That kind of business sense makes his father &#8220screw into the ceiling.&#8221</p><p>When the break-dancing phenomenon swept the country in the early Eighties, Rock hopped on the wave.  After he saw the Fat Boys perform on late-night TV, hip-hop became his obsession.  &#8220I would sit there scratching records all day long,&#8221 he remembers.  Before he was old enough to drive, Rock had become a hit novelty act.  &#8220It was unheard of:  a white guy DJ&#8217ing like a black guy, and having the pizzazz to rock a black party,&#8221 says Rock&#8217s old friend Chris Pouncy, who offered Rock the opportunity to DJ at basement parties in the mostly black working-class suburb of Mount Clemens, Michigan.  &#8220It was almost like a freak show at first.&#8221</p><p>&#8220That&#8217s when everything started,&#8221 Rock says.  &#8220A crew full of black kids would come pick me up and take me to Mount Clemens.&#8221  Says Pouncy, &#8220That was our first encounter with a mansion.  We were like &#8216Man, you rich!&#8217&#8221</p><p>Rock ran away from home several times during high school, often spending weeks at a time with friends in the Mount Clemens projects.  &#8220I must have been fifteen, and shit would just hit the fan,&#8221 he says.  &#8220My parents just didn&#8217t understand what I did.  I wanted to be where the action was.  I didn&#8217t want to be at home, picking apples in the orchard, I wanted to sell dope on the streets, make my money and go buy Paid In Full so I could spin it at a basement party that weekend.&#8221  (Rock didn&#8217t cut all ties with his family during this time &#8211 his mom remembers picking him up from the projects to take him to the orthodontist.)</p><p>Rock says he was the only white kid in an all-black neighborhood.  Cops would ask if he was lost or if he needed a ride home, but rock would respond, &#8220No, I live up here.&#8221  The one time he got hassled by some kids on the street, he retreated to his friend Flo&#8217s mother&#8217s house.  &#8220Mrs. Flo had no teeth and she was drinking Colt 45 out of a fruit jar,&#8221 Rock recalls.  &#8220I told her what happened and I told her not to make a big deal out of it, but she grabbed her gun, ran outside and screamed, &#8216who fuckin&#8217 wit da white boy?!&#8217&#8221</p><p>After barely graduating from Romeo High School, Rock moved back to the Detroit ghetto for the next ten years, sleeping on friends&#8217 couches in the Colchester projects, in Pouncy&#8217s basement and in Gross Point Park, on the run-down corner of Jefferson Avenue and St. Claire Street.  He worked at a car wash, slung crack, and earned extra scratch through his DJ gigs.  To growing acclaim, but no big payoffs, Rock released three records, Grits Sandwiches For Breakfast (1990), The Polyfuze Method (1993), and Early Morning Stoned Pimp (1996). Though his name was worthless outside Detroit, and the Vanilla Ice-inspired revolt against white dudes in rap was in full effect, Rock says he was making progress, winning DJ battles and rap contests, upping his profile.  His father encouraged him to sideline his musical aspirations and take over one of the family&#8217s car dealerships, but Kid rebuffed him.  &#8220I knew that making it on my own terms, and having my dad be proud of me, would be the ultimate freedom,&#8221 he says.</p><p>Rock&#8217s mom helped raise Junior, and she brought food down to the White Room studio, in the heart of downtown Detroit, while Rock and his band began slogging away on his Atlantic debut, Devil Without A Cause.  With huge hits like &#8220Bawitdaba,&#8221 &#8220Cowboy,&#8221 and &#8220Only God Knows Why&#8221 (which he wrote in jail after a bar fight, on the same day he signed to Atlantic), the album would eventually sell 12 million copies.  When he was signed to Atlantic, Rock also made a genius business decision, taking $40,000 out of his advance to buy the masters of two of his previous records from the faltering Continuum label.  When Devil Without A Cause blew up, he sold the masters to Atlantic for a $3 million advance.  &#8220Somehow,&#8221 Rock says, &#8220I always win.&#8221</p><p>With the release of Rock N Roll Jesus, Rock is calm and confident, considering what&#8217s at stake.  Jesus is &#8220a &#8216make it to the next level&#8217 record,&#8221 he says. &#8220That or go play county fairs for the next ten years.&#8221  He believes this is his comeback.  &#8220It&#8217s the best record I&#8217ve ever made, and it&#8217s going to move mountains.  I feel more comfortable in my skin than I&#8217ve ever felt.  I know I&#8217m a great performer.  I&#8217ve done that my whole life, but now I&#8217ve come into my own as a songwriter and musician.&#8221</p>', 1998, NULL),
(165, 'Sugarland', '<p>To hear Jennifer Nettles tell it, it&#8217s a brand new day in Sugarland. Despite winning multiple Grammy, CMA and ACM awards&#8212and selling more than 8 million records&#8212the country-music duo of Nettles and Kristian Bush is embracing a creative rebirth, a musical awakening that permeates their adventurous fourth album, The Incredible Machine.</p><p>&#8220We are in a place of discovery,&#8221 Jennifer says. &#8220It is the essence of who we are as people in this band. There is never a moment where we think, &#8216This is good enough.&#8217 There&#8217s always a place for growth.&#8221</p><p>A growth that Kristian says has been encouraged by their fans, their record label, and, most importantly, by the genre-bending, all-are-welcome country-music industry. &#8220It&#8217s as if the industry and the culture have singled out the biggest risks we&#8217ve taken on a record, a song like &#8216Stay&#8217 for example, and celebrated those,&#8221 he says gratefully. &#8220They&#8217ve embraced us at those times. We&#8217ve tried to learn from that and this is what we&#8217ve made.&#8221</p><p>And what they&#8217ve created is a dynamic masterwork. Co-written and co-produced in full by Jennifer and Kristian, The Incredible Machine is a soaring album elevated by sky-high choruses, ringing guitars, and pulsing drums that recall the beating of the album&#8217s titular engine, the human heart.</p><p>Kristian describes it as a collection of anthems&#8212and there may be no greater understatement. If the duo was searching for the grander side of country on their last record, the double platinum Love on the Inside, they&#8217ve obviously found it on The Incredible Machine. From the fanfare of the album&#8217s opener &#8220All We Are&#8221 to Jennifer&#8217s sublime piano-ballad closer &#8220Shine the Light,&#8221 this is an album built for stadiums.</p><p>&#8220This record is designed to play in very large places and to communicate with a large group of people,&#8221 Kristian confirms. &#8220When you have an instrument as powerful and as graceful as Jennifer&#8217s voice, you don&#8217t want to tip-toe in. You really go for it! And those types of songs are often where Jennifer and I intersect musically.&#8221</p><p>In fact, the pair found shared inspiration in the iconic music and films of the 1980s, their growing-up years. &#8220We allowed ourselves to play with our influences,&#8221 Jennifer admits. As such, the coming-of-age movies by director John Hughes and songs by Blondie, Peter Gabriel, The Pretenders and even The Clash all helped fire up the Machine. &#8220When we were writing, we asked what if John Hughes were making movies now.... Who would be on the soundtrack?&#8221 Kristian says, going on to connect the dots between rebellious country and rebellious rock. &#8220If you dig far enough you&#8217re going to see that The Clash and Johnny Cash had a lot in common. I like to live right where those guys meet.&#8221</p><p>In a song like the joyous &#8220Find the Beat Again,&#8221 for instance, Jennifer reminds the heavy-hearted among us that nothing lasts forever, while Kristian&#8217s siren-like guitar sound&#8212a technique he adapted from The Clash, he says&#8212pushes the song toward its climax.</p><p>Or the call-to-arms &#8220Stand Up,&#8221 in which the band exhorts listeners to &#8220use your voice.&#8221 A tale of personal empowerment, the track is almost heroic in its message. It&#8217s also one of two songs on the album to showcase Kristian&#8217s voice. &#8220I don&#8217t know how many people have really ever heard me sing before,&#8221 he says of his lead verse. &#8220For fans of the band, it&#8217s like a whole new layer is peeled back.&#8221</p><p>&#8220All We Are&#8221 is equally triumphant. A rallying cry of sorts, it culminates in a mass of melodies folding upon one another. The result is breathtaking, a musical equation so intricate that it solidifies the duo&#8217s ability to write complex fare as well as breezy, winking tunes like first single &#8220Stuck like Glue.&#8221</p><p>&#8220We write songs for different reasons. There are some songs that we want to change your life and there are some that we just want to change your day. That&#8217s what &#8216Stuck like Glue&#8217 is,&#8221 Jennifer laughs. &#8220We don&#8217t take ourselves too seriously, and that&#8217s what fans love.&#8221</p><p>They also flock to Jennifer&#8217s knack for finding the voice of everywoman&#8212or even everyman. One of Sugarland&#8217s many gifts is their ability to write lyrics that transcend gender, like in their 2004 breakout hit &#8220Baby Girl.&#8221 On The Incredible Machine, the proof is in the acoustic &#8220Little Miss,&#8221 a profile of a woman who tries to handle everything, all by herself. &#8220I saw my mom as that person. I see pieces of it in my own daughter. Jennifer is certainly one of those women,&#8221 Kristian says.</p><p>Aside from the powerhouse rocker &#8220Wide Open,&#8221 written specifically for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, &#8220Little Miss&#8221 is one of the record&#8217s earliest penned tracks. &#8220We were at a festival over a year ago and I was on the bus doing my makeup while Kristian was warming up,&#8221 recalls Jennifer. &#8220I was wearing a checkered dress and he started playing this lick and singing, &#8216Little Miss checkered dress.&#8217 I popped my head out and sang, &#8216Little Miss one big mess!&#8217 The way that song was discovered was fun and really beautiful.&#8221</p><p>And the band is confident that fans, old and new alike, will have a similar experience as they discover the gears and cogs of The Incredible Machine&#8212a country record, a pop record, an anthem record, a ballad record, but above all, an authentic record.</p><p>&#8220It&#8217s just the two of us,&#8221 says Kristian. &#8220In the story of who we are, this album is more us than we&#8217ve ever been.&#8221</p><p>Jennifer agrees and says the band&#8217s rebirth is best summed up in the gentle, searching words of the album&#8217s title track: Feels like I&#8217m flying, wings made of light/brand new and shinin&#8217, like a shot rung out through the night.</p><p>&#8220That&#8217s a wonderful metaphor and image for this newly emerging creature that Sugarland is right now, with these vulnerable but beautiful wings. The Incredible Machine is definitely us, but at the same time, there is something very precious and new,&#8221 she says. &#8220And we want to show it to the world!&#8221</p>', 2004, NULL);

(166, 'Rod Stewart', '<p>&quotI suppose you could use the word &#39addiction,&#39&quot says Rod Stewart, explaining his relationship to the classic pop standards of his &quotGreat American Songbook&quot series. &quotI&#39m totally addicted to these songs. They&#39re just so great to sing&#8212if you fancy yourself even a bit of a singer, these songs are like chocolate.&quot</p><p>So once again, Stewart has returned to the territory that has defined the last decade of his remarkable career. With FLY ME TO THE MOON&#8230THE GREAT AMERICAN SONGBOOK: VOLUME V, he adds a fifth chapter to the chart-topping, multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning series. On the new album&#8212produced by Richard Perry and co-produced by Rod Stewart, Clive Davis and Lauren Wild - Rod Stewart infuses his incomparable vocal style into 12 iconic standards written by Cole Porter, Johnny Mercer, Henry Mancini, and many others. The immortal compositions on the set include &#8220That Old Black Magic,&quot &#8220Beyond the Sea,&#8221 &#8220What a Difference a Day Makes,&#8221 &quotI&#8217ve Got You Under My Skin,&#8221 &#8220I Get A Kick Out of You,&#8221 and many more.</p><p>Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Grammy&#8482 Living Legend Rod Stewart has been lauded as having one of the most distinctive voices in pop music. The success of the &quotGreat American Songbook&quot albums, which began in 2001 with It Had to Be You..., is truly unprecedented it is the biggest selling ongoing series of new music recordings in history, with over seventeen million copies sold worldwide.</p><p>FLY ME TO THE MOON&#8230, which reunites Stewart with longtime collaborators Richard Perry and Clive Davis, is the first addition to the collection since 2005&#39s Thanks for the Memory&#8230The Great American Songbook: Volume IV. During the five-year break between &quotSongbook&quot albums, Stewart took a couple of genre detours&#8212in 2006, he released Still the Same&#8230Great Rock Classics of our Time, his first rock album in eight years, which entered the Billboard album chart at Number One and followed that with Soulbook, a 2009 collection of classic Sixties/Seventies-era soul favorites, which debuted at Number Four.</p><p>But as soon as he left the world of the &quotSongbooks,&quot Stewart started missing the material. &quotI was sad after we finished the fourth one, but then we went and did the rock album,&quot he says. &quotAs soon as that was done, Richard and I started meddling in, making lists of new songs, laying down some tracks. We were going to bring this one out instead of the Soulbook album, but Clive said, rightly, that we should wait, that the time wasn&#39t quite right.&quot</p><p>For the fifth outing, though, Stewart opted for a slightly new direction and sound. &quotRichard and I decided that we wanted to go more up-tempo this time,&quot he says. &quotClive described the previous records as being kind of &#39Fred and Ginger&#39&#8212which was great, but I wanted to break the mold a bit. I was getting tired of all the tempos sounding a bit the same.</p><p>&quotThe expression &#39If it ain&#39t broke, don&#39t fix it&#39 doesn&#39t really hold in music,&quot he continues. &quotAs a musician, you&#39ve got to follow your own nose&#8212which is quite easy for me, having quite a big nose&#8212and so even though there was a bit of opposition to going this way, this is what I believed, and what I had to do.&quot</p><p>The result is the most danceable &quotSongbook&quot yet. &#8220This album introduces a brand new element to the &#39Songbook&#39 phenomenon&#8212you can&#8217t stop dancing to it,&quot says Clive Davis, Chief Creative Officer, Sony Music Entertainment and a producer of the series. &quotDinner parties all over the world will never be the same.&#8221</p><p>Even with its modified style, FLY ME TO THE MOON&#8230 continues in the history-making tradition of the &quotGreat American Songbook&quot album series.  All four of the previous &quotSongbooks&quot were massive Billboard Album Chart toppers, including the last installment, 2005&#39s Thanks For The Memory &#8230Volume IV, which entered the chart at Number Two. In 2004, Stardust became Stewart&#8217s first ever Number One debut, and earned Rod the first Grammy of his career. As Billboard noted, Stardust also placed Stewart in the extremely rare company of veterans with more than two decades between Number One albums.</p><p>The first &quotSongbook&quot album, It Had To Be You&#8230 (released October 2002), entered the Billboard Top 200 at Number Four, and As Time Goes By&#8230Volume II (October 2003) debuted at Number Two. The first three albums of the &quotSongbook&quot series were all Grammy nominated in the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album category, and all have been certified RIAA platinum in the US.</p><p>Nor has Stewart slowed down in the interim. He just wrapped up a Boxscore chart-topping, 33 date European summer tour which enjoyed the biggest concert gross to date this year abroad, including four sold out dates at London&#8217s O2 Arena.</p><p>With an estimated 250 million in album and single sales, Stewart is one of the most successful performers of all time. No less than the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, called Stewart &quotthe best white soul singer.&quot But no one could have anticipated that at a time when most pop stars would be content to coast on their past accomplishments, he would create an entirely new creative course for himself (which has since become frequently imitated), much less an innovative way to spotlight his much-loved and acclaimed vocal gifts.</p><p>&quotI think I&#39ve cut out my own niche,&quot says Stewart of his experience working with some of the finest and most familiar songs in history. &quotI know these songs I don&#39t even have to listen to anybody else&#39s version. I really don&#39t need any references. These songs have been with me forever.&quot</p><p>The ability to tackle such stellar, challenging material has to start, of course, with the voice. A voice about which Elton John once said, &#8220Bar none, Rod&#8217s the best singer I&#39ve heard in rock &#39n&#39 roll.&#8221 A voice that best-selling author Chuck Klosterman referred to in Spin magazine as &quotthe single greatest male singing voice of the rock era.&quot</p><p>Stewart says that his approach was initially shaped by a variety of sources. When he first encountered the emerging soul sound, he recalls, &quotI was just trying to find my own vocal style. I&#39d started off listening to the Carter Family and Woody Guthrie, and before that I was listening to Little Richard and &#39The Girl Can&#39t Help It.&#39 But Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, all those guys&#8212they definitely sowed the seed.&quot</p><p>Rod Stewart and his characteristically throaty, impressively expressive, and surprisingly versatile voice had been knocking around the London club scene with groups like Steampacket and Long John Baldry&#8217s band before he connected with ace guitarist Jeff Beck in 1968. Their collaborations in the Jeff Beck Group brought Stewart to the spotlight on the blazing Truth and Beck-Ola albums. But it was when Stewart joined forces with the greatest party band in rock history, the magnificent Faces, that he truly hit his stride.<br/>For about a half-dozen years, Stewart went back and forth between recording and touring with the Faces (&quotpunk prototypes,&quot as Wilco&#8217s Jeff Tweedy has called them) and launching his own wildly successful solo career. After his first two albums on his own&#82121969&#8217s The Rod Stewart Album and 1970&#8217s Gasoline Alley&#8212revealed the range and artistry of a vocalist previously best known as a shouter, everything came together for Every Picture Tells a Story in 1971. Universally acknowledged as one of the greatest rock albums of all time, it includes Stewart&#8217s soulful, commanding takes on folk, R&ampB, and blues material the astonishing title track and the international Number One smash, &quotMaggie May.&quot The album also demonstrated that along the way, he had become a top-flight songwriter.</p><p>In the years that followed, Stewart solidified his standing as a superstar. &quotTonight&#8217s the Night&quot proved an even bigger hit than &quotMaggie May,&quot and while other rockers lost ground to a global outbreak of disco fever in 1978, Stewart simply responded with another Number One hit, the notorious &quotDo Ya Think I&#8217m Sexy.&quot</p><p>Throughout the &#821680s and &#821690s, Rod Stewart remained a consistent presence on the charts, with smashes like &quotYoung Turks,&quot &quotForever Young,&quot &quotDowntown Train,&quot and the massive &quotAll for Love&quot trio alongside Sting and Bryan Adams. His Unplugged&#8230and Seated set reunited him with Faces mate Ron Wood, and resulted in a big hit with his intimate version of Van Morrison&#8217s &#8220Have I Told You Lately.&#8221 As the century turned, Stewart underwent throat surgery to remove a benign cancerous node, and also tackled some of his most ambitious material&#8212from contemporary Brit-pop on When We Were the New Boys to new-school R&ampB on Human.</p><p>But no one would have predicted that the next move for this rock &amp roll icon would be an album titled It Had to Be You&#8230The Great American Songbook, a collection devoted to the craft and elegance of songs like &quotThe Way You Look Tonight&quot and &quotThese Foolish Things.&quot Stewart maintained, however, that the project was actually a long time coming. &quotIt wasn&#8217t a sudden impulse or urge,&quot he said, &quotit&#8217s something I&#8217d been wanting to do for as far back as I can remember.&quot</p><p>And the more you think about it, the more logical a step it actually was. Rod Stewart has always been a remarkable interpretive singer&#8212throughout his career, he&#8217s recorded songs by the finest contemporary songwriters, from Bob Dylan to Curtis Mayfield, from John Lennon and Paul McCartney to Cat Stevens. Aside from that unique vocal tone, perhaps his greatest strength is his ability to put across a great set of lyrics clearly and directly.</p><p>&#8220I prefer doing slower numbers,&quot Stewart said as far back as 1970, in an interview with Rolling Stone at the height of the Faces&#8217 popularity. &quotFor a vocalist, a slower number lends itself better than anything else. In opportunities for phrasing, it&#8217s much more free.&quot  Certainly, his cosmopolitan, jet-set persona meshed easily with the sophistication and sexiness exemplified by America&#8217s pop classics.</p><p>If anyone still argued that this new iteration of Rod Stewart&#8212complete with bow tie rakishly undone in the cover photo&#8212seemed at all far-fetched, the public immediately said otherwise. It Had to Be You&#8230The Great American Songbook entered the charts at Number Four, Stewart&#8217s highest perch in years, and went on to sell more than five million copies. Not that anyone knew what the public response would be&#8212&#8220Rod was doing it out of sheer determination,&#8221 said manager Arnold Stiefel. &#8220As he said to me, we&#8217ve waited 20 years to sing these songs and I&#8217m going to give them my all, and if the album sells 25,000 copies, so be it.&#8221</p><p>As Stewart took to the road behind It Had to Be You&#8230The Great American Songbook, he continued to strengthen a following for this material. The &quotFrom &#8216Maggie May&#8217 to the Great American Songbook Tour&quot (captured on the One Night Only! Live at Royal Albert Hall DVD) was completely sold out for three years in a row. In 2003, he released As Time Goes By&#8230The Great American Songbook: Volume II, which included duets with Cher and Queen Latifah. This time, he entered the charts at Number Two.</p><p>With 2004&#8217s Stardust&#8230The Great American Songbook: Volume III, the &quotSongbook&quot series established itself as a truly historic phenomenon. The album entered the charts at Number One&#8212the first chart-topping debut of Stewart&#8217s career, and his first Number One in more than 25 years. Guests on Stardust included Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder, adding a more modern edge to these beloved tunes. The resultant tour was one of the year&#8217s five biggest, and to cap it all off, there was a long-awaited Grammy for &quotBest Traditional Pop Vocal,&quot Stewart&#8217s first trophy after 14 nominations over the years.</p><p>With Thanks for the Memory&#8230The Great American Songbook: Volume IV, he streamlined the arrangements, and shook up the &#8220Songbook&#8221 formula by adding some different flavors into the mix, especially a duet with Chaka Khan on Sam Cooke&#8217s &quotYou Send Me,&quot and songs with Elton John and Diana Ross.</p><p>The Great American Songbook series pushed Rod Stewart&#8217s career into uncharted territory&#8212in his fifth decade as a performer, he was now selling more records than ever and cultivating a new and growing audience. &quotRod has become an inspiration to all artists,&quot says Clive Davis, Arista/J Records founder and Chief Creative Officer, Sony Music Entertainment, &quotshowing how long a truly great career can soar when one is willing to broaden and reinvent oneself.&quot</p><p>It was Davis who came up with the idea of revisiting the rock songs that Stewart&#8217s fans had grown up with. The result was Still the Same...Great Rock Classics of Our Time, on which Stewart took the lessons learned from the &#8220Songbooks&#8221 and applied them to a thoughtfully chosen set of songs crafted by such masters as Bob Dylan (&#8220If Not For You&#8221), Van Morrison (&#8220Crazy Love&#8221), and John Fogerty (&#8220Have You Ever Seen the Rain&quot). The range of its production was displayed in sounds from the soaring Badfinger hit &#8220Day After Day&#8221 to the Pretenders&#8217 1994 ballad &#8220I&#8217ll Stand By You.&#8221</p><p>His next recording took Stewart all the way back to the music that initially inspired him to sing. &quotThis is the album I&#8217ve waited my whole lifetime to record,&quot he wrote in the liner notes to Soulbook. Though he has recorded numerous soul standards over the years (&quotThis Old Heart of Mine,&quot &quotI&#39m Losing You,&quot &quotHaving a Party&quot), he said that the songs selected for this album &quotwere the oxygen that fueled my passion to sing. Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, James Brown, The Temptations, The Four Tops, and so many more&#8230they were my Gods and my heroes.&#8221</p><p>A number of remarkable guest stars contributed to the Soulbook recordings. Mary J. Blige and Jennifer Hudson joined Stewart for duets, while Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder contributed to new versions of their own songs.</p><p>After these forays into material from his own generation, though, Rod Stewart was ready to get back to the classics from the 1930s and &#3940s that played in his own household during his youth. He and Richard Perry began meeting for dinner, discussing song choices, and sketching out a sound.</p><p>&quotI&#39d take a song and give Richard the key, the tempo, the feel, and then he would go to the studio and work out the arrangement,&quot says Stewart. &quotRichard has a pub on his property in Los Angeles&#8212it&#39s quite historical, been around for many years&#8212and pretty much all of the vocals were done in the pub. It&#39s a lovely way to work!&quot</p><p>The results, featuring swinging horns and finger-snapping rhythms, break new ground for the &quotSongbook&quot series. Stewart sounds relaxed and playful on a sassy rendition of &quotLove Me or Leave Me&quot &quotSeptember in the Rain&quot is played as a cool shuffle, complete with a vibes solo. Not that the romance of the &quotSongbooks&quot is absent from FLY ME TO THE MOON&#8230&#8212&quotWhat a Difference a Day Makes&quot and &quotMy Foolish Heart&quot feature vocals that are notably expressive and intimate.</p><p>The singer credits Perry (who has co-produced several volumes of the &quotSongbook&quot series, and also worked with such luminaries as Barbra Streisand, Carly Simon, Diana Ross, and Harry Nilsson) with the disc&#39s verve and energy. &quotI can&#39t give enough credit to Richard&#8212this is really his album,&quot says Stewart. &quotWith all due respect to everybody who has worked on these albums, and have all done a great job, he really understood and appreciated this music more than anybody.&quot</p><p>Though Stewart notes that his wife&#39s favorite track is &quotMoon River&quot (&quotevery time she hears that one, she cries&quot) he says that his own favorite performance comes on the album&#8217s title track, which was recorded very casually during the album&#39s earliest stages. &quotI remember that we talked about it, I sang it a couple of times, we went out to dinner, and I forgot all about it,&quot he says. &quotRichard put together a vocal from those takes and I thought, &#39Blimey! I&#39ve done a great job of that.&#39 I was just in the right mood, wasn&#39t under any pressure&#8212I went back and tried it again, but I just couldn&#39t better it.&quot</p><p>Stewart adds that there was an additional motivation for the up-tempo direction that he chose for FLY ME TO THE MOON&#8230. &quotI&#39m thinking of doing a full &#39Songbook&#39 tour next year, and I know I would need some up-tempo stuff to hold an audience,&quot he says. &quotAfter the second album, I did a tour where we tried to mix my old songs with these songs, but this time I&#39m thinking of going out with a proper orchestra&#8212no &#39Maggie May&#39 or &#39Hot Legs,&#39 just do these songs the right way. That would really be the fulfillment of a dream.&quot</p><p>In the meantime, though, he expresses satisfaction and pride with his return to the Great American Songbook. &quotIt&#39s really a happy album when you look at it,&quot he says. &quotFor me, the hallmark is that I keep playing it a lot, and I very rarely go back and listen when I&#39ve finished an album. I&#39m my own worst critic, but I&#39m just knocked out by this one. I&#39m over the moon with it.&quot</p>', 2001, NULL),
(167, 'Black Dub', '<p>Black Dub is the latest project from acclaimed musician and producer Daniel Lanois, a legendary guitarist and composer who has produced seminal albums for U2, Bob Dylan, Brian Eno, Willie Nelson and Neil Young. Lanois is what historians like to call a musician&#8217s musician.</p><p>In Lanois&#8217 own words&#8230</p><p>Black Dub is essentially a three-piece band with a high level of musicianship. We don&#8217t operate on a technological grid. Nor are we tied to a page of fixed notes. Our songs are fluid. Often recorded live. One take. No overdubs. It&#8217s a very old fashioned idea really.</p><p>I think that might be why we get such a strong response on YouTube. Each video we create is a live musical performance shot with a hand-held camera seen through the eyes of one individual. No cuts. No edits. It&#8217s clear that people still have an appetite for something honest and authentic with real musicians playing live. In these sad times of prepackaged music, people yearn to experience something soulful, heartfelt, something meaningful. As simple as it sounds, real music is a rare commodity these days.</p><p>Our first CD is very real - kind of a rock thing, steeped in the Jamaican culture of dub, which I love. On a good day, I see myself carrying the torch of [famed Jamaican producer] Lee Scratch Perry. I wrote this music from a dub perspective, which I believe is very soulful.</p><p>What do I mean by soul? Soul music is a music that needs to exist, for the right reasons, beyond business preconceptions &#8211 natural reasons that resonate deep inside. I think this band has it. Whether we&#8217re playing at a club or in the studio, at our best, there is something breathless and spontaneous going on here.</p><p>On Brian Blade&#8230</p><p>Every stroke of Brian Blade&#8217s drumming has church in it. This man grew up in the band at his father&#8217s Baptist church in Shreveport, Louisiana, so he&#8217s been serving singers all his life. A gospel choir is a mighty force and you can&#8217t serve that kind of singing if you are a fake with a big ego. This is music that demands respect and humility. That&#8217s what makes Brian&#8217s playing so pure and free.</p><p>In addition, Brian honed his skills studying with New Orleans masters Ellis Marsalis, David Lee, Jr. Bill Huntington, Mike Pellera, George French, Germaine Bazzle, Steve Masakowski and John Mahoney. As a drummer, Brian is a true original, so inventive he never plays the same thing twice.</p><p>Don&#8217t take my word for it. Ask jazz stars like Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Joshua Redman and Bill Frisell, with whom Brian has also worked. Or songwriters like Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Seal and Nora Jones. Plus, Brian recorded several albums with his own bands, the Brian Blade Fellowship and Perceptual, as well as a solo album that came out last year.</p><p>On Trixie Whitley&#8230</p><p>Trixie Whitley is an amazing singer with such a strong sense of commitment in her voice. She grew up on Etta James and the classic soul singers. Talk about soul. She&#8217s got it, in her blood. Trixie comes from a family of musicians in Texas and New Orleans - her father being the late great blues singer Chris Whitley, a friend who I was lucky enough to work with many years ago. Trixie is young and full of fire: the voice of a generation.</p><p>Words from the songstress herself&#8230</p><p>Black Dub is made up of many ingredients, but all the ingredients come from the same place: the soul. To me, soul music isn&#8217t just Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye. It&#8217s Joni Mitchell too. It comes from a deep emotional place inside you. It&#8217s pretty much the opposite of the comfy fast food approach to culture. It&#8217s about what touches you, what penetrates your heart. It&#8217s about how you work with what your soul responds to most</p><p>Discovering the lighter side of Black Dub according to Blade&#8230</p><p>Dan writes some heavy music, both instrumentally and lyrically. He writes from the heart, the mystery of the heart. That mystery from which our deepest feelings and secrets unfold: love and loss, joy and hope, fear and darkness. The name Black Dub may sound dark, but Dan always keeps a light on.</p><p>An evolutionary perspective from Lanois&#8230</p><p>You know how every now and then you witness an impossible stroke of Mother Nature? Say, for instance, you&#8217re looking up at some huge concrete bridge and you notice a tiny, delicate vine sprouting through the structure. Maybe a seed got stuck in a crack. The power in that little bud will eventually erupt into a labyrinth of vines across the bridge. If you tried to plan out something like that you couldn&#8217t pull it off. But there it is, before your eyes, something magical just bursts into existence for natural reasons.</p><p>As a musician, I look for those little seeds that catch on their own. Spotting is what I call it. For me, music is not about inventing something from scratch. It&#8217s about expanding on something that has a natural beginning. A flash of a moment that has something special about it. I like to flirt with such natural diversions. Oftentimes they can grow into something quite substantial.</p><p>I had the good fortune recently to visit Brian&#8217s father&#8217s church and sit in with the band. They were so many superb singers in that choir, real natural down-to-earth people with regular jobs who could out-sing practically any star in the music business. I so admire musicians like them. The way they see it, their singing, their voices belong to the community. They don&#8217t sing for money. For members of that choir, singing is about praise.</p><p>I&#8217m not much of a churchgoer, but I think of music as praise too. I think of God as a great molecular collective. If you&#8217re trying to do good and you come to the end of each day having made a few improvements in your life, not necessarily monetarily, but spiritually, I think that&#8217s godliness. I like that about Black Dub. It&#8217s a collective. Without a doubt the people in this band embrace the same values. We are made of the same fiber, personally and philosophically. And in the end, I see that as the overriding ingredient of Black Dub. Beyond entertainment, beyond commerce, it is the fiber of our music. And that&#8217s enough for us.</p>', 2010, NULL),
(168, 'Keith Urban', '<p>You can&#8217t blame gravity for falling in love.&#8221 &#8212 Albert Einstein</p><p>On Defying Gravity, the openhearted and uplifting new album by Keith Urban, there is a deeply felt musical statement, a life-affirming song cycle marked by a clearheaded sense of passion and hope. From the opening romantic yearning of &#8220Kiss A Girl&#8221, to the heartfelt gratitude of the closing &#8220Thank You&#8221, Defying Gravity offers listeners the inspiring and stirring sound of a great musical artist coming of age and creating his most personal and effecting music yet.</p><p>&#8220Fortunately, this is where I am at right now in life, in my marriage, and in my home with a new girl,&#8221 Urban says of Defying Gravity&#8217s truly joyful and thankful mood. &#8220And coming the road that I&#8217ve taken to be here, I do feel a lot of gratitude.&#8221</p><p>The road that Keith Urban has traveled to get here has been uniquely his own. How else on earth to explain how this kid, born in Whangarie, New Zealand and raised in Caboolture, Queensland Australia, has grown up to somehow become one of the biggest stars in the very American world of Country music?</p><p>Since first moving to Nashville back in 1992, Keith Urban has gradually established himself as an extraordinary singer, songwriter, guitarist, and performer who has brought his own distinctive talent, energy, and charisma to Country music and beyond. In return, Urban has now established himself as both a global superstar and a highly respected artist with the impressive track record to prove it, including Grammy Awards, Country Music Association Awards, Academy of County Music Awards and Australia&#8217s coveted Aria Award. He has a loyally devoted worldwide fan base that comes to see him every time he takes the stage, as he connects with the people who have made it all possible.</p><p>Keith Urban&#8217s millions of fans have followed his creative progression from his first American album as a member of The Ranch (1997), through an increasingly accomplished series of the Platinum-selling solo albums, Keith Urban (1999), Golden Road (2002), Be Here (2004), and Love, Pain &amp the whole crazy thing (2006), as well as the compilation Greatest Hits: 18 Kids (2007). And so for a decade now, Urban has remained a welcome and enduring presence on Country radio thanks to a series of popular and memorable songs, including such 1 hits as &#8220But For The Grace Of God,&#8221 &#8220Somebody Like You,&#8221 &#8220Who Wouldn&#8217t Wanna Be Me,&#8221 &#8220You&#8217ll Think Of Me,&#8221 &#8220Days Go By,&#8221 &#8220Making Memories Of Us,&#8221 &#8220Better Life,&#8221 &#8220You Look Good In My Shirt&#8221 and &#8220Start A Band,&#8221 Urban&#8217s 2008 guitar and vocal duet with pal, Brad Paisley. And as a core artist on all Country video outlets, Urban&#8217s career to date has also been documented on a series of Platinum video collections.</p><p>In recent years, Urban&#8217s remarkable musical gifts have also brought him to numerous places where Country superstars have rarely gone before, whether powerfully dueting with Alicia Keys on the Rolling Stones&#8217 &#8220Gimme Shelter&#8221 on the stage of Live Earth, appearing on Saturday Night Live, or sitting in with the likes of Al Green, Justin Timberlake, BB King and John Mayer at this year&#8217s Grammy Awards.</p><p>&#8220I have a real appreciation for the long, colorful, diverse musical road I&#8217ve taken to get here,&#8221 Urban explains of his musical journey. &#8220All through my youth in Australia, I got to play in so many different situations. I grew up in Tamworth -- which is sort of the Country music capitol of Australia -- playing and competing there, but I also formed my own band playing West Coast Rock stuff that I loved. Then I got a job as a musical director for a cabaret singer, so I was learning &#8220Twelfth of Never&#8221 and &#8220Viva Las Vegas&#8221 too. At 16, I had to wear a tuxedo and count off the band. You name it -- I played it in every pub and club in Australia, and that&#8217s given me a great palette to draw upon. I feel very lucky to have all these opportunities to play with so many artists who I really admire. Playing with people -- and playing for people -- is what it&#8217s all about.&#8221</p><p>And so Urban is thrilled to get the chance to play for people on his upcoming &#8220Escape Together World Tour&#8221 Together with KC Masterpiece&#169 and Kingsford&#169&#8221, which kicks off in May, and will bring him to fans everywhere throughout the summer, joined by his special guests including Sugarland, Taylor Swift, Dierks Bentley, Jason Aldean, Lady Antebellum, Little Big Town, The Zac Brown Band and even one of his childhood heroes, Glen Campbell.</p><p>&#8220With Defying Gravity being a very up record, I feel like these songs lend themselves toward playing live,&#8221 Urban says. &#8220We&#8217ve spent a lot of the past year playing arenas, which is mind-blowing, and it feels like these songs will work in that sort of space. Also this year is difficult for a lot of people and going to shows is such a good way to get away from everything. I hope the shows can be a moment to escape from everything and be immersed in this other world for a while -- to sing along and be a part of something else. I love touring and playing for people and having that sense of togetherness, of oneness. I don&#8217t want to play at people, but with people. It&#8217s not me and them, it&#8217s us -- so the idea of escaping together is perfect.&#8221</p><p>For all the success and the close relationship he has made with his fans, the road that Keith Urban has taken has not been without its bumps, which only makes the happiness and peace that Urban has finally found in his own life, a subject he explores musically on Defying Gravity, all the more meaningful. Produced by Urban and Dann Huff, another gifted guitarist and longtime collaborator, Defying Gravity looks from a variety of perspectives at love as a life-saving, ever-changing force in our lives, from the excitement of courting on a song like &#8220Sweet Thing&#8221, to the atmospheric heartbreak of &#8220&#8217Til Summer Comes Around&#8221, to the pure desire of &#8220Standing Right In Front Of You&#8221, to the constant longing for a love on &#8220Why&#8217s It Feel So Long.&#8221</p><p>As Urban explains, &#8220It wasn&#8217t a conscious theme, but listening back, I think the album is about being brave enough to love, which is difficult for a lot of people to do. Most people who have loved have been hurt, and to love for a second or a third time is very, very hard. The tendency is to want to protect and pull back, but that&#8217s the very thing we can&#8217t do.&#8221</p><p>With Defying Gravity, Urban is bravely putting his passion, musical and otherwise, on the line as never before. As he explains, &#8220Between marriage and sobriety and having a child, it&#8217s been an extraordinary gift that I just couldn&#8217t have imagined, or maybe I could have imagined but didn&#8217t know how, or when&#8230or if. So, for those things to come together now is absolutely beautiful. It&#8217s allowed me to be present in a way I&#8217ve never quite been. I was always thinking about tomorrow, or the past, anywhere but here. Even though I made an album called Be Here, I still wasn&#8217t ever really here. Now I love being present &#8211 I have a lot to be grateful for in the present.&#8221</p><p>Listen closely to Defying Gravity &#8212 gratitude has rarely sounded so good.</p>', 1999, NULL),

The 18 songs on the album include duets with such legends as Ray Charles, Willie Nelson, and Dolly Parton, and with 21st Century icons from OutKast to the Foo Fighters.</p><p>&#8220It&#39s so exciting and flattering and fun when I get asked to sing with somebody that I admire,&#8221 says Jones. &#8220It takes you a little bit out of your comfort zone when you&#39re doing something with another artist. You don&#39t know what to expect&#8212it&#39s kind of like being a little kid and having a playdate.&#8221</p><p>The tracks on &#8230Featuring span her entire career, from one of her earliest recording sessions (a version of Roxy Music&#8217s &#8220More Than This&#8221 with guitarist Charlie Hunter in 2001) to her most recent performance, a song called &#8220Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John&#8221 that she cut with Belle and Sebastian, which will also appear on their new album. The result serves as a kind of parallel history to her own four albums, which have sold over 40 million copies worldwide.</p><p>These collaborations reveal Jones&#8217s astonishing musical versatility, from jazz to country, hip-hop to rock. Three of the songs on &#8230Featuring originally appeared on records that won Grammy awards for Album of the Year (Ray Charles&#8217 Genius Loves Company, Herbie Hancock&#8217s River: The Joni Letters, and OutKast&#8217s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below), and several others were also nominated for Grammys.</p><p>The album also includes recordings by some of Jones&#8217s own bands and side projects (The Little Willies and El Madmo), and performances with artists that she&#8217s toured with including M.

(170, 'Katy Perry', '<p>&#8220I can&#8217t run from where I came from, nobody can,&#8221 says Katy Perry. When it came time to make her exhilarating second album &#8220Teenage Dream,&#8221 Katy found herself increasingly drawn back home to Santa Barbara, Calif. Back to where they knew her before she became a superstar. Before she kissed a girl and liked it. And, certainly, before she sold 5 million copies of her Capitol Records blockbuster, &#8220One of the Boys.&#8221</p><p>&#8220I love the vibe that Santa Barbara gives off and I wanted to really tap into the purity of my childhood and that feeling,&#8221 says the two-time Grammy nominated singer. &#8220It was really fun to get away and walk into the studio with no make-up on.&#8221</p><p>&#8220Teenage Dream,&#8221 out Aug. 24, will move you, both emotionally and physically. &#8220When I was touring, I wanted people to dance more,&#8221 Katy says. &#8220So I wrote an album that made people move, yet didn&#8217t sacrifice the story substance that I had on the last record.&#8221</p><p>The album, whose producers include Max Martin, Tricky Stewart, Stargate, Dr. Luke and Greg Wells, is a glorious evolution from &#8220One of The Boys,&#8221 It showcases an artist who dares us to join her as she experiences every facet of life.</p><p>&#8220I&#8217m giving everyone the full spectrum on this record,&#8221 Katy says. &#8220You&#8217re getting the sugary sweet, but you&#8217re also getting the &#8216Oh my goodness, she had to sit down for a minute and let some things off her chest&#8217.&#8221</p><p>Fun first single, &#8220California Gurls,&#8221 declared by Entertainment Weekly as &#8220unforgettable,&#8221 is the undeniable summer anthem of 2010. Featuring Snoop Dogg, &#8220Gurls&#8221 is a sizzling salute to sun-kissed days spent in Daisy Dukes and a bikini top. Other album highlights include the heartbreakingly wistful &#8220The One that Got Away,&#8221 the naughty, playful strut of &#8220Peacock,&#8221 the uplifting &#8220Firework,&#8221 the pulsing, stinging &#8220Circle the Drain,&#8221 and the spiritual quest of &#8220Who Am I Living For.&#8221</p><p>And then, of course, there&#8217s the passionate, thumping title track. &#8220I called the album &#8216Teenage Dream&#8217 because I feel like I will always want to be that pin-up poster,&#8221 Katy says. &#8220I definitely want to be in everybody&#8217s dreams at all times until I get to Liz Taylor&#8217s age when I&#8217m not in your dreams anymore, and I&#8217m just a diva!&#8221</p><p>It&#8217s irreverent statements like this that have branded Katy a true American original.  She&#8217s the extremely talented girl next door with slyly captivating charm. After Katy topped Maxim&#8217s Hot 100 this Spring, Maxim editor-in-chief Joe Levy mused of her appeal: &quotIt&#39s that feeling you get when you suddenly realize that the smartest, funniest, coolest girl you know also happens to the best looking and a pretty good skateboarder, too. All of sudden, your crush goes supernova, and this is Katy&#39s supernova moment.&quot</p><p>She&#8217s the face most likely to adorn the bedroom walls of young girls who adore Katy not only for her musical brio, but for her playful yet sophisticated fashion sense (Who else could wear a blinking dress that lights up to the Metropolitan Museum Costume Institute&#8217s Gala?) &#8220I don&#8217t ever really want to come off as trashy,&#8221 she says. &#8216But I want people to know I&#8217m definitely having fun.&#8221</p><p>Of that, there&#8217s no doubt. Seldom has an artist catapulted onto the world scene and captured not only people&#8217s ears, but their hearts as well. Since the 2008 release of &#8220One of the Boys,&#8221 Katy has taken a jet-fueled rocket pack to the top, wowing fans with her often whimsical, irresistible pop songs. Katy topped charts in more than 25 countries with cultural phenomenon &#8220I Kissed a Girl,&#8221 &#8220Hot N Cold,&#8221 &#8220Thinking Of You&#8221 and &#8220Waking Up in Vegas,&#8221 and has sold more than 22 million digital tracks and mobile products worldwide.</p><p>Katy erases any barrier between pop star and audience by writing all her own material.  &#8220You&#8217re getting a pure connection to the artist,&#8221 Katy says. &#8220You&#8217re not getting some idea of what that artist should be, you&#8217re getting a direct voice.&#8221  Nowhere is Katy&#8217s voice and vision clearer than in concert. She is a relentless road warrior, albeit one who comes complete with gigantic, blow up plastic strawberries to toss into the audience. As a newcomer, she stormed the Warped Tour stage for 47 dates in 2008, immediately winning over hardened rock fans with her ceaselessly energetic live show. Since then, she has steadily built audiences across the planet by touching down in more than two dozen countries and filling increasingly larger venues each time she returned to a city. 2009&#8217s headlining &#8220One of the Boys&#8221 tour was a phenomenal success, selling out around the world.</p><p>She&#8217s also a popular television draw, appearing on countless talk shows, presenting and performing on the Grammys living out her lifelong dream of being lowered from the ceiling in a 600 lb. banana, serving as a guest judge on &#8220American Idol,&#8221 a celebrity contestant on &#8220Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&#8221 for St. Jude Children&#8217s Research Hospital and hosting MTV&#8217s Europe Music Awards twice. More often than not she&#8217s adding to her trophy case at each stop, winning Best New Act at the Europe Music Awards, Best Pop Video at the MTV  Japan Awards and International Female Solo Artist at the Brit Awards.</p><p>As much as her life seems to play itself out in the press&#8212she&#8217s appeared on the cover of  more than 15 magazines--she reminds us the real Katy is in every note and every word of her music. &#8220If you ever want an answer about how I felt about something or what I was going through or what I believe or my convictions or my love,&#8221 she says, &#8220You just have to listen to the lyrics.&#8221 We can&#8217t wait to hear every word she has to say.</p>', 2008, NULL),

But all it takes is one listen to the 15 year-old soul-singing phenomenon to realize that he is light years ahead of his manufactured pop peers.</p><p>After posting dozens of homemade videos on YouTube in 2007, where the multi-talented Bieber put his impeccable spin on songs from artists like Usher, Ne-Yo and Stevie Wonder, Justin racked up over 10,000,000 views purely from word of mouth.</p><p>&#8220I started singing about three years ago,&#8221 says the Canadian native who grew up an only child in Stratford, Ontario. &#8220I entered a local singing competition called Stratford Idol. The other people in the competition had been taking singing lessons and had vocal coaches. I wasn&#8217t taking it too seriously at the time, I would just sing around the house. I was only 12 and I got second place.&#8221</p><p>In an effort to share his victory with his loved ones, Justin began posting his performance footage online. &#8220I put my singing videos from the competition on YouTube so that my friends and family could watch them,&#8221 he says. &#8220But it turned out that other people liked them and they started subscribing to them. That&#8217s how my manager found me. He saw me on YouTube and contacted my family and now I&#8217m signed!&#8221</p><p>Seven months after Justin started posting his videos online, former So So Def marketing executive Scooter Braun flew the then 13-year old singer to Atlanta, GA to meet with his elite colleagues. As if Justin&#8217s natural singing talent wasn&#8217t enough to impress Scooter&#8217s inner circle, Braun knew Bieber was also a self-taught musician who plays the drums, guitar, piano and trumpet.</p><p>&#8220Right when we flew into Atlanta, Scooter drove us to the studio and Usher was there in the parking lot,&#8221 remembers Bieber. &#8220That was my first time ever being out of Canada so I went up to him and was like, &#8216Hey Usher, I love your songs, do you want me to sing you one?&#8217 He was like, &#8216No little buddy, just come inside, it&#8217s cold out.&#8217&#8221</p><p>All it took was a short time online for Usher to realize he was in the company of a future superstar. &#8220A week later Usher flew me back to Atlanta,&#8221 says Bieber. &#8220I sang for him and his people and he really wanted to sign me then and there but I still had a meeting with Justin Timberlake who also wanted to sign me.  It turned out Usher&#8217s deal was way better. He had L.A. Reid backing him up and Scooter had a lot of really good connections in Atlanta.  I always tease Usher now and remind him he how he blew me off the first time we met.&#8221</p><p>In October of 2008, Justin Bieber officially signed to Island Records.  His debut album, My World is an intimate look into the mind of a budding young renaissance man. With production from star hit men like The Dream and Tricky Stewart who produced &#8220Umbrella&#8221 for Rihanna and Beyonce&#8217s latest smash, &#8220Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It),&#8221 Justin has everything he needs to achieve pop supremacy.</p><p>His first single, &#8220One Time&#8221 produced by Tricky, is about one of Justin&#8217s favorite topics, puppy love.  Usher joins Justin on &#8220First Dance&#8221 where the two share verses on a song that Bieber describes as, &#8220A slow groovy song that people can dance to.&#8221 On the Midi-Mafia produced &#8220Down to Earth&#8221 Justin digs deep to talk about growing up.  &#8220Bigger&#8221 finds the teenaged singer maturing at a steady rate, while motivating his listeners to strive for their goals.</p><p>&#8220I&#8217m looking forward to influencing others in a positive way,&#8221 says Justin. &#8220My message is you can do anything if you just put your mind to it. I grew up below the poverty line I didn&#8217t have as much as other people did.  I think it made me stronger as a person it built my character.  Now I have a 4.0 grade point average and I want to go to college and just become a better person.&#8221</p><p>A virtually untapped well of natural artistic talent, Justin Bieber is primed to be a solid force in music for many years to come. &#8220I think older people can appreciate my music because I really show my heart when I sing, and it&#8217s not corny,&#8221 he says. &#8220I think I can grow as an artist and my fans will grow with me.&#8221 And just think, he&#8217s just getting started.</p>', 2009, NULL),

If you&#39re    Selena Gomez, you dance. At least, you get the world on its feet with &quotA Year Without Rain.&quot A follow-up to &quotKiss &amp Tell,&quot Selena&#8217s gold-certified Hollywood Records debut CD, &quotA Year Without Rain&quot shows Selena and her band, The Scene, in a whole new light, this one pulsating, multicolored and ready for the mirrored ball.<br/>&quotI really wanted something that felt good to perform, but had a techno/dance vibe,&quot Selena says. &quotI wanted something that had meaning and melody, and more empowering lyrics.&quot That&#8217s exactly what she delivers in &quotA Year Without Rain.&quot Working with top producer/songwriters like Tim James &amp Antonina Armato, Kevin Rudolf, Toby Gad and Jonas Jeberg, Selena kept to a more quickened tempo, exploring themes of love, freedom and the joy of living for the moment.<br/>Selena credits the album&#8217s neo-techno leanings to her 2010 platinum-certified single, &#8216Naturally,&quot which pointed the way for her. That track &quotreally helped me figure out where I want to be,&quot she says. &quotThere&#8217s a feeling when I perform that song that I love, so when I was going back in the studio, I had a better understanding of where I wanted to be musically.&quot<br/>She gets right to it with the opening track, &quotRound &amp Round,&quot an upbeat synth-driven song about reaching the limits of indecision in love. The plaintive &quotA Year Without Rain&quot may be more subdued, but its beauty impressed Selena enough to make it the title track. &quotWhen I got the song, I went through the roof,&quot she recalls. &quotEverybody has that one person they can&#8217t live without. It was exactly what I wanted to say.&quot That goes double for the Spanish version of the song, Selena&#8217s first recording in that language.<br/>Having turned 18 this year, Selena has matured since making her professional debut at age 7, but girls still wanna have fun, which is what songs like &quotSpotlight&quot &quotOff the Chain&quot and &quotSummer&#8217s Not Hot&quot are all about. &quotRock God&quot features none other than Katy Perry on backing vocals, while &quotIntuition&quot boasts a duet between Selena and rapper Eric Bellinger in a tricked-out double-time salute to a positive attitude.<br/>Selena slows things down on &quotGhost of You,&quot a ravishing ballad about a breakup so rough, no amount of &quotliving crazy loud&quot can crush the memory. &quotIt&#8217s very beautiful, very raw,&quot Selena says of the song. &quotShelly Peiken co-wrote it. She knows me, knows about everything I go through, and knows how to express it in a beautiful way.&quot<br/>On the flip side, Selena comes back strong with &quotSick of You,&quot a Matt Squire-written and produced track about losing a loser (&quotYou know fairy tales don&#8217t come true/ Not when it comes to you&quot). The album ends with &quotLive Like There&#8217s No Tomorrow,&quot an epic power ballad expressing the creed by which Selena has built her life and career.<br/>A Dallas native, Selena Gomez started acting at age seven when she landed a role in the popular television series &quotBarney &amp Friends,&quot on which was a regular for two seasons. She landed her first film role in the 2003 sci-fi action adventure film &quotSpy Kids 3-D: Game Over.&quot She made her mark as an actress playing girl wizard Alex Russo in the hit Disney Channel series &quotWizards of Waverly Place,&quot which premiered in 2007 and has now completed three seasons. Selena and her cast mates won a 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#8217s Program.<br/>Selena then made an indelible impression with her starring role in 2010 comedy &quotRamona and Beezus.&quot Says Selena, &quotI wanted something completely different from my show. All these incredible actors, being able to learn from them and get my feet wet in the film world. It was the perfect way to get into it.&quot Next up, a starring role in &quotMonte Carlo,&quot in which she plays a teen on vacation in the romantic European principality. And of course, Selena is gearing up for the fourth season of &quotWizards of Waverly Place.&quot<br/>Selena has branched out into fashion with the premiere of her new clothing line, Dream Out Loud, sold exclusively at K-Mart. But her instinct for charity remains strong. She is a proud UNICEF ambassador, and will appear for a third year at UNICEF&#39s Trick or Treat bash, this time to kick off UNICEF&#39s 60th anniversary. And with the new album comes a new tour with her band.<br/>Having her own band has been a comfort for Selena as she hits the road with &quotA Year Without Rain.&quot Scene members Ethan Roberts (Guitar), Joey Clement (Bass), Greg Garman (Drums) and Dane Forrest (Keyboard) back her on tour and help shape her emerging sound. &quotOn my TV show we have an ensemble cast that&#8217s like a family,&quot she says. &quotIf anyone&#8217s missing, you feel it. I wanted that family feel in my music, and we definitely have that with the Scene.&quot<br/>That family feeling had grown to include fans around the world, each of them all in when it comes to following Selena Gomez on her amazing artistic journey. Where&#8217s she headed? She&#8217ll let you know when she gets there. &quotI&#8217m still figuring out who I am,&quot she says. &quotI love expressing that through music, and through film.

Aguilera notes, &#8220Working on this album with so many talented artists and producers that I admire was really an amazing experience. The artists I chose to work with added so many unique sonic layers to Bionic.  My intention was to step into their world and what they do combined with my own vision and sound. The results were magic.&#8221  The album also features a ballad produced and written by Linda Perry titled &#8220Lift Me Up&#8221. The title Bionic reflects Aguilera&#8217s ability to take her range to new levels and use her voice in various ways never heard before.<br/>Aguilera describes the album as a unique mix of many genres and styles of music, &#8220I was able to explore and create a fresh, sexy feel using both electronic and organic elements with subject matter ranging from playful to introspective.  I am so excited for my fans to hear the new sound. It is something I don&#8217t think anyone will expect.&#8221<br/>In addition to completing the album which was all recorded from her home studio after the birth of her first son, Christina also completed production on her first film, &#8220Burlesque.&#8221 The film, which co-stars Cher, Stanley Tucci, and Kristen Bell will be released by ScreenGems this fall.</p>', 1999, NULL),

(183, 'Ke$ha', '<p>If there&#8217s one thing Ke$ha knows how to do, it&#8217s tell stories. Here&#8217s a pretty good one: Two years ago, the aspiring pop singer and songwriter decided she wanted Prince to produce her first album. So, she found out his address and drove to his Beverly Hills home, where she paid the gardener five dollars to let her squeeze herself under his front gate. Then she hiked up the driveway (which was lined in purple velvet), let herself in through an unlocked side door, and rode the mirrored elevator up to the third floor where the Purple One himself was jamming with his band. &#8220It was kind of awkward,&#8221 she recalls, &#8220but who cares, right? So I sat on one of the purple thrones in the room until he noticed me, which he finally did. He was like, &#8216How the hell did you get in here?&#8217&#8221 she says with a laugh. &#8220His security kicked me out, but not before I left him my demo CD wrapped in a giant purple bow.&#8221</p><p>Ke$ha never did hear from Prince, but the incident speaks volumes about this 22-year-old newcomer&#8217s firecracker personality and determination. &#8220I&#8217ve always known I wanted to be a performer,&#8221 she says. &#8220There&#8217s video of me at age five, naked and covered in body paint, saying, &#8216I&#8217m going to be a rock star and there&#8217s no way anyone is going to stop me!&#8217 It&#8217s my calling. If I don&#8217t go for it, I&#8217m going to feel like a tool when I&#8217m 50.&#8221</p><p>Luckily, Ke$ha won&#8217t have to find out what regret feels like. She is currently at work writing and recording her debut album with executive producer Dr. Luke, who has scored No. 1 smashes for Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Avril Lavigne, and Flo Rida. After falling for her playful half-sung/half-rapped vocal delivery on a rough demo, Luke brought Ke$ha to RCA Records, which signed her in February 2009. The album &#8212 which will also feature Ke$ha&#8217s collaborations with veteran hitmaker Max Martin (Pink, Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears) and in-demand songwriter/producer Benny Blanco (Katy Perry, 3OH!3, Spank Rock) &#8212 is shaping up to be an edgy collection of hard-hitting electro-pop songs, made all the more irresistible by their high-octane punk energy and Ke$ha&#8217s irreverent lyrics and attitude. &#8220I want my music to be fun, unapologetic, rowdy, quirky, humorous, and interesting,&#8221 she says, &#8220but with substance behind it. I&#8217m an emotional person underneath all my fronting. I want people to listen to it and feel like they can relate.&#8221</p><p>Not surprisingly, the songs showcase Ke$ha&#8217s flair for storytelling, though her choice of subject matter isn&#8217t exactly conventional. There&#8217s a song about the time Ke$ha threw up in a closet during a party at Paris Hilton&#8217s pad (&#8220Party at a Rich Dude&#8217s House&#8221), and one she says is about the time &#8220some dumb bitch fronted like she was my friend but then secretly tried to bring me down&#8221 (&#8220Backstabber&#8221), and another about finding out her boyfriend was cheating on her with a famous pop starlet who shall remain nameless (&#8220Kiss &amp Tell&#8221). Oh, and the one she wrote about beginning to see the universe as a cyclical chain of connected events after meeting a guy in a club (&#8220Chain Reaction,&#8221 which has been featured on MTV&#8217s The Hills).</p><p>Ke$ha credits her love for story-songs to spending her formative years hanging out with veteran songwriters in Nashville. Her mom Pebe, a former punk-rock singer, is a songwriter whose career took off in Music City in the late &#821770s when a song she co-wrote, called &#8220Old Flames Can&#8217t Hold A Candle To You,&#8221 became a hit for Joe Sun in 1978 and a country chart-topper for Dolly Parton in 1980. But by the time Ke$ha was born in 1987 (during a party in Los Angeles&#8217 San Fernando Valley, Pebe was going through a bad patch, struggling to support Ke$ha and her older brother through her music. &#8220We were on welfare and food stamps,&#8221 Ke$ha says. &#8220One of my first memories is my mom telling me, &#8216If you want something, just take it.&#8217&#8221</p><p>In 1991, Pebe moved the family back to Nashville, where she had landed a new publishing deal. Ke$ha saw the inside of a lot of recording studios. &#8220I thought everyone grew up in a recording studio,&#8221 she says. She attended a music school in the Tennessee countryside (&#8220where some of the kids didn&#8217t have any shoes,&#8221 she recalls), took songwriting classes, and fell in love with country music greats Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and Patsy Cline. &#8220I&#8217d listen to these beautiful songs and they all told stories,&#8221 she says. &#8220Bob Dylan&#8217s Nashville Skyline is one of my all-time favorite records.&#8221 From time to time, Pebe let Ke$ha sing on tracks she was working on. &#8220My mom always told me, &#8216You have a good voice, practice singing,&#8217 so I&#8217d sing everything all the time,&#8221 Ke$ha says.</p><p>When Ke$ha was 17, she quit high school, &#8220which was crazy because I was enrolled in an International Baccalaureate program and was going to go to Columbia University and study psychology,&#8221 she says, &#8220but I wanted to move back to L.A. and pursue my music.&#8221 That&#8217s when she met Dr. Luke. &#8220I had been looking for a female artist with an incredible, distinctive voice who had her own style,&#8221 Luke says. &#8220Ke$ha didn&#8217t sound like anybody else.&#8221 Dr. Luke was also working with red-hot hip-hop artist Flo Rida on a track for his second album. One night, Ke$ha was hanging out with them and the rapper told her he wanted a female voice on a track and asked if she wanted to lay down a vocal. Naturally, she obliged. In February, that track, &#8220Right Round,&#8221 soared to No. 1, selling more than 636,000 downloads its first week out, and shattering the all-time one-week digital single sales record. (Ke$ha also contributes her sassy vocal stylings to &#8220Touch Me,&#8221 another track from Flo Rida&#8217s upcoming 2009 album R.O.O.T.S.)</p><p>&#8220When I first heard my voice on &#8216Right Round&#8217 on the radio, I started screaming and crying,&#8221 Ke$ha says. &#8220I may seem kind of crazy, but behind it all I have my s**t together. I&#8217m working really hard to make this happen and it&#8217s nice to see that hard work pay off. I mean, three years ago I was stealing canned vegetables from the dollar store to survive. Now I&#8217m on a No. 1 song, working on my album, and have a little change in my pocket. To be able to take my mom out to dinner is the best feeling in the world.&#8221</p>', 2009, NULL),

It&#8217s also about being experimental and taking songs we&#8217ve liked from the past and playing around with sick, crazy beats.&#8221</p><p>In keeping with that  manifesto, the first single from The Beginning is &#8220The Time (Dirty Bit),&#8221 which is built around a sample from the classic 1987 theme from Dirty Dancing, (&#8220I&#8217ve Had) The Time of My Life,&#8221 recorded by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. &#8220The song is a celebration of this amazing time in our lives,&#8221 says vocalist Fergie. &#8220We&#8217ve been on tour all over the world, and looking out at stadiums full of people who came out to see us &#8212 that&#8217s as big as it gets. After the shows, we go out to the clubs and meet the fans those are moments that we have to remember.&#8221 &#8220Plus the fact that we get to experience it with each other,&#8221 adds vocalist apl.de.ap, &#8220that&#8217s the best feeling ever.&#8221</p><p>&#8220You never know what&#8217s going to happen, so you want to make the best of every day,&#8221 says will.i.am. &#8220We wanted to capture that feeling and release a song that celebrates with the fans because it wouldn&#8217t have happened without them.&#8221 This album is the beginning of a new era of Pea world domination -- fasten your seat belts pea-ple enjoy the ride, declares Taboo.</p><p>The Black Eyed Peas have shot a video for &#8220The Time (Dirty Bit),&#8221 with director Rich Lee, who also lensed the Peas&#39 &#8220Imma Be Rocking That Body&#8221 video, as well as clips for Eminem (&#8220Not Afraid&#8221), The All-American Rejects (&#8220The Wind Blows&#8221), Fergie (&#8220Clumsy&#8221), and  the Pussycat Dolls (&#8220Hush Hush&#8221).</p><p>The Beginning will be released in several physical formats &#8211 a standard CD, a deluxe CD that includes 3 bonus songs, a full album vinyl and a combo two-disc set of 20 songs that includes The Beginning &amp The Best of THE E.N.D. &#8211 and digitally at all online retailers.</p><p>The Black Eyed Peas are currently on the road on their BlackBerry Presents &#8220The E.N.D. World Tour 2010,&#8221 which culminates this fall with shows in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru after extensive North American and European legs over the past year. The New York Times described the tour as &#8220pop&#8217s latest sci-fi spectacle,&#8221 while Spin.com raved &#8220they push the boundaries of what it means to be one of the top-selling acts in music today&#8221 and the New York Post declares a &#8220visually stunning production.&#8221</p><p>The E.N.D. was The Black Eyed Peas first original music since 2005&#8217s Monkey Business, which was certified triple platinum in the U.S., with worldwide sales of more than nine million. Monkey Business generated Grammy Awards over two consecutive years, for &#8220Don&#8217t Phunk with My Heart&#8221 and &#8220My Humps.&#8221 The Peas&#8217 first Grammy Award came six years ago, for &#8220Let&#8217s Get It Started,&#8221 from their breakthrough 2003 album Elephunk, which introduced Fergie into the lineup, and transformed the group into interna&#172tional superstars with cumulative 25x platinum sales in nearly a dozen countries around the world. In 2006, Fergie released her six-million-selling solo debut The Dutchess and 2007 Producer of the Year Grammy-nominee will.i.am released Songs About Girls. Since forming in 1995, The Black Eyed Peas have sold more than 28 million albums worldwide and more than 30.8 million digital tracks. In addition, they have logged more than 300 headline tour dates in 29 countries with more than 2.2 million tickets sold. The group has been nominated for a 2010 American Music Award in the Favorite Band, Duo or Group category.</p>', 1998, NULL),

(189, 'Lady Gaga', '<p>Lady Gaga is a theatrical dance-pop performer whose debut single, the international chart-topping hit &quotJust Dance,&quot established her as an up-and-coming superstar upon its release in 2008. Born Stefani Germanotta on March 28, 1986, the Yonkers native attended Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girl Catholic school in Manhattan, before proceeding to study music at New York University&#39s Tisch School of the Arts at age 17. Influenced by flamboyant glam rockers such as David Bowie and Freddie Mercury (she would later draw her stage name from the Queen song &quotRadio Ga-Ga&quot) as well as &#3980s dance-poppers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson, she began playing the piano at a young age and started writing original material as a teenager. In 2007, she began to make a name for herself on the downtown Manhattan club scene with a performance art show billed as Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue (co-featuring Lady Starlight born Colleen Martin, a DJ and makeup professional), and music industry insiders began to take note. While Lady Gaga was initially signed to Def Jam in 2007, nothing came of that association, and ultimately it was pop-rap superstar Akon who took her under his wing, signing her to his vanity label Kon Live in association with Interscope Records.</p><p>In addition to working for Interscope as an in-house songwriter, Lady Gaga began preparing the launch of her solo career. Her debut single, &quotJust Dance,&quot was released to radio in April 2008, and her full-length album debut, The Fame, followed in August. Featuring fellow Akon affiliate Colby O&#39Donis, &quotJust Dance&quot slowly gathered momentum throughout 2008&#39s latter half. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in August, at which time it had already become a massive club hit, but it didn&#39t reach number one until January 2009. Internationally, the song proved similarly popular, reaching the Top Ten throughout much of Western Europe and beyond. In the wake of Lady Gaga&#39s international breakthrough success with &quotJust Dance,&quot the follow-up single &quotPoker Face&quot was an even larger hit, topping singles charts across the board with its combination of pop melodicism and club-worthy production. Two additional tracks -- &quotLoveGame&quot and &quotPaparrazi&quot -- also cracked the Top Ten, and The Fame was still enjoying a spot on the Billboard Top 40 when its follow-up, The Fame Monster, appeared in November 2009. Although originally planned as a bonus disc (to be packaged alongside The Fame in a deluxe edition of Lady Gaga&#39s debut), The Fame Monster was quickly expanded to eight tracks, thus warranting its own release. Meanwhile, the leadoff single &quotBad Romance&quot became Gaga&#39s fifth consecutive Top Ten single.</p>', 2008, NULL),
(190, 'Sara Bareilles', '<p>Hi.<br/>It&#8217s me, Sara. As I&#8217ve said before, I don&#8217t do those fancy bios. So sue me.</p><p>Kaleidoscope Heart is my new album, and I&#8217m beyond proud of this collection of songs, in no small part due to the fact it was like pulling teeth to write them.<br/>We spent the better part of three years touring and supporting my first record, Little Voice, and by the end of that process I was completely burnt out. Don&#8217t get me wrong, it was an unbelievable ride that far surpassed my expectations in the best way. We had some unforgettable high points as well as some very humbling low ones, and like any good rollercoaster, it&#8217s exhilarating but you still feel a little bit sick at the end and are happy to have your feet on the ground again.</p><p>I thought that I would use our much-needed time off to just pour myself into writing, but I actually found that I wanted nothing to do with music for a little while. I preferred drinking copious amounts of coffee, going to yoga, and looking for cute throw pillows at Target. I love throw pillows.<br/>As the time passed, I slowly started writing again, and truly amazed myself with just how horrible the songs were. And then the fear set in.<br/>I think I fell victim to what a lot of artists go through with a second record: the expectations, the pressure, the anxiety of what&#8217s to come, the idea that maybe I&#8217ve already written my best work&#8230</p><p>Weeks before I was supposed to start recording, I was in full-scale panic-attack mode, feeling pressure to start the ball rolling again, but not having material I cared about. I only had about 4 new songs that I really loved, and the rest were truly embarrassing.  Thankfully, over a margarita, my good friend Matt said something profound and poetic that made it all come clear:<br/>He said, &#8220You can&#8217t polish a turd. A bad song is a bad song. Ask for more time.&#8221<br/>And so I did.</p><p>My manager suggested only recording the 4 songs I loved and I agreed. Thank God he did, because the floodgates opened after a taste of what being in the studio would look and feel like. It was easy, and exciting, and infinitely inspiring. I wrote the rest of the record in about a month, largely based around the song &#8220Uncharted&#8221 that still feels like the centerpiece to me. My fear of what was to come was keeping me from doing anything. And finally, I cared about what I was saying.<br/>As homage to the song that freed me, I took the title of the record from its lyrics.</p><p>My counterpart in the studio, Neal Avron, is one of my Buddhas in this world. He&#8217s one of the most patient, musical, kind, and dedicated people I&#8217ve ever met. We were an odd pairing for sure, as he&#8217s best known for his rock records (Fall Out Boy, Say Anything), and I do covers of songs from Dumbo and love the Golden Girls. But it was exciting and felt completely right. We spent about 6 months making this record, and the record that came from it is exactly what I wanted. With Neal&#8217s help, I took risks, and pushed myself both as a player and vocally, and I followed my gut wholeheartedly for the very first time. And I can&#8217t wait to share it.</p><p>I can&#8217t wait to see these songs come to life.</p><p>I can&#8217t wait to reconnect with fans from the stage. I can&#8217t wait to see how many times the word &#8220Kaleidoscope&#8221 gets misspelled.</p><p>I can&#8217t wait to get on the ride again.</p>', 2007, NULL),

(192, 'Train', '<p>Pat Monahan - vocals<br/>Jimmy Stafford - guitar<br/>Scott Underwood &#8211 drums</p><p>Over the course of 15 years, Train has made its mark on music history with their Grammy-Award-winning song &quotDrops of Jupiter (Tell Me)&quot and chart-topping singles &quotMeet Virginia&quot and &quotCalling All Angels.&quot Since forming in San Francisco in 1994, the multi-platinum selling band has traveled a long, successful and sometimes arduous journey. Following their 2006 release, For Me, It&#39s You, the band took a three-year hiatus, and in that time, Train has, for all intents and purposes, experienced an epiphany as a whole. Now, with their fifth album, Save Me San Francisco, Train has channeled their early days, revisiting the roots rock sound that has made the band such a tour de force &#8211 and, in turn, the band is united stronger than ever before.</p><p>&quotI think taking time away from each other really made the heart grow fonder,&quot frontman Pat Monahan says of the break. &quotWe realized how important we were to one another and taking a few years off helped us all really look at ourselves and what we could contribute to this band as opposed to what we weren&#39t getting from the band.&quot</p><p>When looking back, Train credits the city of San Francisco with cultivating the band&#39s identity and foundation, so it&#39s no wonder than the title track of the record would pay homage to the Bay Area metropolis the band holds so dear. &quotWe owe all of our gratitude to San Francisco because they embraced us back when, if they hadn&#39t have, no one would have,&quot Monahan explains. &quotBasically, this album is our way of paying tribute, giving thanks and also recognizing that we kind of need San Francisco to OK this band before anybody else does. Those were the best times of our lives &#8211 even though we didn&#39t know it &#8211 living in San Francisco and struggling to make a band work.&quot</p><p>&quotSave Me San Francisco&quot is an autobiographical account of Train&#39s beginnings, and embodies not only the spirit of the album, but also the soul of Train as a band. The song&#39s lyrics take the listener through the three-piece&#39s humble start in the mid-90s up through the time when Monahan, in particular, left the City by the Bay. &quotIt&#39s very related to my existence, but Jimmy, Scott and I have been through a lot together in the last 14-15 years, so it represents a lot to them, too, because they don&#39t reside in San Francisco anymore, and we all miss it.&quot</p><p>Train spent April and May of 2009 holed up in London&#39s Kensaltown Studios with producer Martin Terefe (KT Tunstall, Jason Mraz, James Morrison) with whom Monahan credits with helping the band &quotget back to the roots of the first record.&quot &quotIt was an incredibly refreshing environment that Martin created for the band,&quot the singer says. &quotI&#39m really appreciative of his approach on things because he&#39s really great at what he does. I had more fun making this record than ever in my life. I think I&#39ve made seven records and it was by far the most fun.&quot</p><p>Save Me San Francisco taps into Train&#39s organic sound, recalling the blues and folk-infused rock that put the band on the map from the start. &quotIt&#39s pretty basic,&quot Monahan explains of the record. &quotBut really cool because there&#39s super catchy riffs and melodies in it, which I think are way more important that any production trick or great-sounding vocal production. It&#39s kind of us going backward so we can go forward.&quot<br/>It is befitting that the focus of Save Me San Francisco is as uncomplicated as the record sounds. Monahan explored the age-old concept of love through his signature storytelling lyrics and the album, as he explains, is &quotabout love in every way you can think about it.&quot</p><p>&quotThere are certain songs that, instead of there being an intention, there was almost a theme,&quot he says. &quotI think a lot of the way I wrote on this wasn&#39t necessarily, &#8216Hey, this reminds me of a situation I was in,&#39 but more how I see certain things being lived out in life, whether it&#39s from myself or someone else&#39s perspective.&quot</p><p>In this day and age, career artists are few and far between, and after a decade and a half of being a band, Train is ready to present one of their strongest efforts to date. Monahan recognizes the band&#39s accomplishments, and, as he states so clearly, is more than grateful for the success they have experienced. However, for a band as consummate as Train is, Monahan still sets his goals high and hopes the band&#39s fans will continue to come along for the ride.</p><p>&quotI still remember what it&#39s like to paint houses,&quot he recalls. &quotI had fun because I loved the people that I worked with, but it&#39s really not what I want to do &#8211 not because it&#39s a degrading job or anything, but because when I&#39m on stage I feel so much more connected to who I think I truly am. I just want to stay connected to the highest level myself can be and I think it comes through music. With that said, I&#39ll never stop wanting to sell out Madison Square Garden, so my goals are very simple, but they&#39re pretty big at the same time. I think Train fans who have watched the good and the bad, have been a part of all of it and have loved some of the music and not liked some of the music, are really going to like this record a lot -- I think, much more than they have in years.&quot</p>', 2006, NULL),
(193, 'Ray LaMontagne', '<p>&#8220There&#8217s something magical that happens when these musicians play together,&#8221 says Ray LaMontagne. &#8220I&#8217ve been wanting to capture what we&#8217ve been doing live for a while. The chemistry is really special.&#8221</p><p>The billing on LaMontagne&#8217s fourth album, God Willin&#8217 &amp the Creek Don&#8217t Rise, reveals instantly that something new is happening with this project. The record is credited to &#8220Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs&#8221&#8212the first time that the singer/songwriter has defined himself within a band setting, rather than as a solo artist. In addition, it marks the first time that LaMontagne has taken on the role of producer. And as soon as the music starts, with the Joe Cocker-style soul power of the opening &#8220Repo Man,&#8221 it&#8217s apparent that one of the world&#8217s most acclaimed artists has moved into some fresh territory.</p><p>Not that he was necessarily in need of a new direction. The album is the follow-up to 2008&#8217s Gossip in the Grain, which debuted in the Top Five on the Billboard charts garnered two 2010 Grammy nominations earned LaMontagne a coveted slot performing on Saturday Night Live and continued the expansion of a highly-respected career that began with his first album, Trouble, in 2004.</p><p>The line-up of the Pariah Dogs, and their alliance with LaMontagne, is already well-proven and familiar. These musicians&#8212Eric Heywood and Greg Leisz on guitars, Jennifer Condos on bass, and Jay Bellerose on drums&#8212have been working as the singer&#8217s touring band for the last few years, and developing into a tight-knit team. Though he had thought about trying to get all of these busy session players together in the studio before, only now did time and circumstance align and make it possible.</p><p>For one thing, there was a new work set-up that LaMontagne was excited about. &#8220I just bought this old estate in western Massachusetts that belonged to the first US ambassador to Russia,&#8221 he says. &#8220There&#8217s this beautiful room in the house, that was once a connected barn that was turned into a ballroom in the early 1900&#8217s and I felt like it would make a great place to record.</p><p>&#8220It was an unknown space and an unknown situation, but it all worked,&#8221 says drummer Bellerose. &#8220It was one of the easiest sessions I&#8217ve ever done&#8212the songs just played themselves. We were scheduled to record for two weeks, but we were done tracking in five or six days.&#8221</p><p>The last song on God Willin&#8217, &#8220The Devil&#8217s in the Jukebox,&#8221 was the first thing that the group recorded. Bellerose notes that this simple, bluesy track set a tone for the sessions. &#8220It was kind of a springboard,&#8221 he says. &#8220It loosened everybody up, gave us a chance to breathe.&#8221</p><p>&#8220That&#8217s one of those songs I tend to write that is so damn linear, it&#8217s up to us to make it interesting,&#8221 says LaMontagne with a laugh. &#8220If you take it apart, there&#8217s not a lot happening. But the way these guys approach songs is always surprising. Where they take the melody, the interplay between the rhythm section&#8212who knows what they&#8217re going to come up with?&#8221</p><p>Guitarist Heywood says that the singer &#8220made a decision beforehand to trust the band, and he really stuck to that.&#8221 He points to the album&#8217s title track as an example of the way these sessions allowed each song to find its own path. Heywood and Leisz both play pedal steel, and they looked to LaMontagne to determine the arrangements and instrumentation.</p><p>&#8220On that one, he said, &#8216How about two pedal steels?,&#8221 Heywood recalls. &#8220And then Jay started doing this bombastic, artillery-style drum thing. The song reads as a letter, with no chorus or bridge, so the whole thing was the most surprising track for me, and definitely one of my favorites. And Ray&#8217s vocal performance is amazing.&#8221</p><p>Ray LaMontagne has one of the remarkable stories in music&#8217s past decade. Since leaving his job in a Maine shoe factory to pursue his calling as a musician, he has released three studio albums and two live EPs, won awards and topped critics&#8217 polls internationally, and established himself as one of the most distinctive talents of his generation. His songs have been featured in numerous films and television shows, including multiple performances of his compositions on American Idol.</p><p>Yet he maintains that, until God Willin&#8217, all of these accomplishments have come despite his own struggles in the recording studio. &#8220The process has always been laborious, it&#8217s been difficult for me to get any momentum,&#8221 he says. &#8220I always felt like I was swimming upstream.&#8221</p><p>But this time, things were different. &#8220Ray was really in his comfort zone,&#8221 says Bellerose. &#8220He was home with family, he&#8217s really relaxed around this band&#8212there was never a moment that felt uncomfortable. I think he&#8217s just having a lot more fun communicating with more people, and getting out of being on his own as a singer/songwriter.&#8221</p><p>LaMontagne claims that he didn&#8217t specifically set out to write songs for this group of musicians, though he certainly had its sound in his mind. Regardless of the outcome, he says that his process didn&#8217t&#8212and can&#8217t ever&#8212change.</p><p>&#8220For me, songs just have to happen, they have to come out of nowhere,&#8221 he says. &#8220Otherwise it sounds like you&#8217re trying to write a song, and I can spot that a mile away&#8212and I think listeners can, too.</p><p>&#8220I won&#8217t ever sit down and write unless something is knocking at the door. I can go months without writing a song&#8212and that&#8217s when it gets scary, when you feel like you&#8217re never going to write another song because they&#8217re just not coming around.&#8221</p><p>LaMontagne&#8217s steady output, however, indicates that there&#8217s little cause for concern. And for God Willin&#8217 &amp the Creek Don&#8217t Rise, in addition to his own extraordinary writing, these ten songs had the benefit of contributions from an exceptional bunch of musicians, collaborating under ideal conditions. Even the notoriously self-critical LaMontagne can&#8217t hide his delight at the results.</p><p>&#8220These guys are all so good, and I trust their instincts, I just wanted to write songs that I felt would excite them,&#8221 concludes LaMontagne &#8220There was a certain amount of pressure, because they&#8217re so much more accomplished than I am as a musician. But I knew that if I could pull together a batch of songs I was happy with, there was really no risk involved.&#8221</p>', 2006, NULL);

(194, 'Enya', '<p>It is one of the most extraordinary stories in contemporary music. Very few people would have seen the potential fully, when a young slip of a girl from Donegal, on the remote north western tip of Ireland, by the name of Eithne N&#237 Bhraon&#225in, first hooked up with Nicky Ryan and his partner Roma Ryan.</p><p>It was the tail end of the 1970s and by then Nicky was a well established sound engineer and producer, having worked his aural magic on a plethora of Irish albums, among them records by the band that he and Roma had managed together, trading under the name of Clannad (a gaelic word meaning family). Eithne &#8211 pronounced Enya &#8211 had been a member of that group for what amounted to the blink of an eye, slipping briefly in alongside her siblings to play keyboards. It didn&#8217t last and so when the chips were down, and it was time for everyone involved to pledge their long term allegiance, Enya, Nicky and Roma decided to pursue a dream together.</p><p>To those on the outside it might have seemed like a strange and unlikely allegiance. But to look at it that way was to seriously underestimate Nicky Ryan&#8217s musical vision and integrity, as well as Enya&#8217s talent. He had worked with some of the finest Irish musicians of the era, including the seminal Planxty. His knowledge of contemporary music stretched into rock on the one side and the more experimantal branches of contemporary folk on the other. He had developed a mastery of  the craft of recording, and planned to build a studio in the back garden of the house that he and Roma shared in the low key suburb of Artane on the North side of the city, where he could put his command of the speakers and the faders to even more productive use. All that was in his head when Enya arrived in Dublin, bristling with talent. When the call had to be made as to how to go forward, he and Roma &#8211 a visual artist by background and a powerful ally always in making the tough decisions &#8211 joined forces with Enya. They were in this together. They would be partners for the long haul, with the studio as their base.</p><p>She was already an accomplished, clasically trained player, but Enya took advanced piano lessons to further develop her skills. Things moved slowly, perilously so, and there were lean years when it was hard to keep the wolf from the door. She taught piano on the side. Collectively, they battened down the hatches. Enclosed in their private world in the studio in Artane, Enya worked on composing, and Nicky weaved his sonic spell. They felt they were getting somewhere but things were tough in the music industry generally and even tougher in Ireland, where, as the 1980s progressed, the level of unemployment was reaching record levels. It needed patience. As it turned out the triumvirate had that in abundance.</p><p>Enya wrote a couple of instrumentals for a local compilation record. Instinctively, Roma felt they had a cinematic appeal: listening to them her imagination ran free and the images flowed. She sent the tracks to the celebrated British film producer David Puttnam. Impressed, he commissioned Enya to write the music for the film The Frog Prince. While most of the album was orchestrated, Enya recorded two tracks, &#8216The Frog Prince&#8217 and &#8216Dreams&#8217, with Nicky, in the recording retreat they had by now named Aigle Studios. The lyrics for the title track were written by Roma, defining the moment at which the members of the core creative team definitively established their credentials, and the mutual trust that would be essential to their work together. As things evolved, while the roles might shift, overlap and be shared in different permutations, it became clear that Enya was a group consisting of three people, with Enya &#8211 or Eithne &#8211 as the focal point and lead singer, Nicky as producer and Roma as lyricist.</p><p>The cinematic quality to Enya&#8217s compositions brooked no resistance. The Frog Prince was followed by another commission, this time to write the music for a six part BBC television documentary, entitled The Celts. With lyrics by Roma, some co-written with Enya, and Nicky in the producer&#8217s chair, there was a haunting, ethereal quality to much of the work that enticed listeners into an increasingly distinctive aural world. There was also drama in abundance. Recorded in 1986, and collected onto an album in 1987, entitled simply Enya, in record industry terms it was a relatively low key BBC release &#8211 but it provided a crucial breakthrough nonetheless.</p><p>There are times when you have to marvel at the way in which a roll of the dice can lead us into unexpected places and ultimately define the course of our lives. If there was a remarkable and unpredictable synchronicity about the manner in which Enya, Nicky and Roma had been drawn together by a combination of circumstance, intuition and belief (with a bit of good fortune thrown in), then more was to follow. Rob Dickins, the chairman of Warner Music in the UK heard the Enya album and was enchanted by it. At an awards ceremony in Dublin he met the singer and, following up within a matter of days, on the basis of an instinct that he hardly understood, in a genuine act of musical faith he put a recording contract on the table. Enya, Nicky and Roma accepted.</p><p>It was written in the stars. I remember listening to Enya&#8217s official debut album Watermark before it was released and being astonished at just how good it was. It achieved the remarkable distincton of being by turns both big and intimate, lavish widescreen, almost Spectror-esque production values on tracks like &#8216Storm In Africa&#8217 sitting comfortably alongside pieces of  sparse and timeless classical beauty, like the wonderfully evocative title track. Using the Prophet 5 as its core instrument and layering Enya&#8217s voice in vast banks of unison and harmony vocals, it was a fresh and impressive take on what people might have tried to pigeon hole as a &#8216new age&#8217 or Celtic sound &#8211 but there was a highly sophisticated pop sensibility at work too, especially on the lead single &#8216Orinoco Flow&#8217. An invigorating lyrical trip around the world that name-checked as many as 20 places &#8211 from Tripoli in Libya to the Isle of Ebony from the Persian tale from The Thousand and One Nights &#8211 as a single it became a wonderfully positive and optimistic opening salvo, its complete absence of cynicism reflected in the fact that Rob Dickins himself was accorded a humorous nod of appreciation in the lyrics. It was a massive hit, going to No.1 in the UK and in Ireland, as well as in the European Hot 100 &#8211 powering Watermark to the top of the charts in its slipstream. In the long run, the album would sell over 8 million copies worldwide, but even in the early stages it became clear that Enya, Nicky and Roma had an unprecendented hit on their hands.</p><p>There are events for which the phrase &#8216poetic justice&#8217 might have been invented. Knowing the individuals involved, the vicissitudes they&#8217d had to deal with along the way and the hard work and determination which they had invested, individually and collectively, in launching the Enya phenomenon, it amounted to a thoroughly deserved vindication.</p><p>The massive scale of the success of &#8216Orinoco Flow&#8217, effectively the debut single by an unknown artist, took just about everyone&#8217s breath away. Where other artists might have attempted to crank up the machine and go on the road in support of the record, the beauty of it was that Enya didn&#8217t need to. Buoyed by the stratospheric chart performance of its lead single, Watermark was selling in vast quantities too. And besides there was a thorny question as to how the album&#8217s huge sound might be represented effectively in a live context. The more the record sold, the less pressure there was to undertake what might have proven to be a difficult and costly endeavour.</p><p>The unexpected bonus of the decision not to tour was that the Enya enigma grew. Who was she? Where did she live? What was she like? There are many artists who, having achieved what is often misguidedly termed overnight success, suffer quickly from over-exposure and find their careers withering. Enya was never going to be one of them, her innate reserve and desire for privacy being bolstered by the unique circumstances of her success.</p><p>The follow-up Shepherd Moons was released in 1991. It was another huge hit, not only giving the Enya team their first UK No.1 album, but also delivering their Stateside breakthrough, as the album sailed up the Hot 100 and into the Top 20 for the first time. But what was happening with Enya&#8217s music and its quiet proliferation, had a deeper root than the chart position achieved by any one record might indicate. In 1990, the Gerard Depardieu hit Green Card had featured three tracks from Watermark. In 1991, the romantic comedy LA Story, a vehicle for the comedian Steve Martin, also featured three Enya tracks, including two from Watermark. Already a hit, Shepherd Moons carried on in the same vein, tracks gracing Barry Levinson&#8217s Toys (&#8216Ebudae&#8217) the box office smash Far And Away (&#8216Book Of Days&#8217), the hit TV series Baywatch (the single &#8216Caribbean Blue&#8217) and Martin Scorcese&#8217s acclaimed The Age Of Innocence (&#8216Marble Halls&#8217). Roma Ryan&#8217s early insight that Enya&#8217s music had a special cinematic quality was proving remarkably prescient and durable.</p><p>It went further too. Enya&#8217s music was being widely played on radio you heard it in shops, in lifts and in bars and even while you waited to be put through on the telephone. It had no ambition to be cutting edge or avant garde, but it had captured the moment nonetheless in the most extraordinary way, as reflected in the lives and tastes of an incredible number of ordinary people going about their fractured daily lives and seeking something mystical or other-worldly to act as a balm against the ravages. The haunting, atmospheric quality of Enya&#8217s compositions was a key factor in this regard, but Nicky Ryan&#8217s meticulously assembled wall of sound production style was crucial too, as evidenced by the fact that musicians and producers from the unlikeliest schools were also tuning in and taking note. In 1992, the Enya album was remastered and released in the US as The Celts. One of the songs on the record, the inspiringly gothic, breathy, percussion-driven &#8216Boadicea&#8217, had featured in Luc Besson&#8217s Le Grand Bleu (The Big Blue) and in 1992 was again used in a movie, this time the adaptation of Stephen King&#8217s Sleepwalkers, with resounding effect. Triggered by the movie, The Fugees  would sample it without permission for their massive global smash &#8216Ready Or Not&#8217 and Mario Winnan would repeat the sampling exercise for his 2004 hit &#8216I Don&#8217t Wanna Know&#8217, for which Enya was credited as co-writer.</p><p>With the ongoing success of Enya&#8217s records, the money was available to invest in a new studio set-up in the house to which Nicky and Roma moved in Killiney on Dublin&#8217s south coast and, with its construction, the Enya team became even more self-reliant. No one else needed to be involved until the master was delivered to the record company. What would they have had to offer anyway, that the core team couldn&#8217t do as well themselves, or even better? Three persons in the one Goddess: it made perfect sense.</p><p>The Memory Of Trees, released in 1995 gave Enya her first top ten album in the US, and her first No.1 record in Australia, Spain and Sweden she was now an established international star, with millions of loyal fans throughout the world and increasingly in the fertile territories of the east, including Japan. But, along with Nicky and Roma, she remained true to her Irish roots, living, writing and recording in Dublin and frequently singing in Gaelic, among an increasingly rich tapestry of languages that Roma was exploring in the song-lyrics, including Latin and Spanish.</p><p>The release of Paint The Sky With Stars: The Best Of Enya in 1997 meant that it was five years before the follow-up to The Memory of Trees was released. A Day Without Rain, launched in 2000, was trailered by the single &#8216Only Time&#8217, which became Enya&#8217s biggest hit to date, climbing to No.10 in the US Hot 100 as well as No.1 in Germany and Switzerland. It was a song that, in different ways, took on a life of its own. In the first instance, it was used by NBC as the soundtrack to ads for the hugely popular TV series Friends, inspiring a resurgence in radio play that fuelled sales of the album. And then, on September 11, 2001, terrorists from the radical, extremist Muslim paramilitary group Al Qaeda launched a murderous series of attacks, the first of which saw the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in New York being toppled, and thousands of innocent lives lost. It was the single biggest disaster in the US since the attack on Pearl Harbour during the second world war, with the fatalities ultimately running higher even than that  bloody act of war.</p><p>In the wake of these horrific events, a visual essay, showing images from the attacks, was assembled by a private New York citizen, put on the worldwide web and widely shared among internet users in the US and beyond. It used &#8216Only Time&#8217 as its soundscape and the track became a surrogate theme song in the post-apocalyptic atmosphere that prevailed after 9/11, its sad serenity providing a badly needed counterpoint to the profound sense of devastation and upheaval occasioned by the catastrophe. No one knew what the future held or where the fallout from the attacks would take us. The theme of the song had acquired a new urgency, reflecting the widespread feeling that only time would reveal the extent of the wounds that had been inflicted and how long it would take for them to heal, if indeed they ever would. A Day Without Rain went on to become Enya&#8217s biggest selling album to date, with sales of 13 million.<br/>Roma Ryan&#8217s intertest in esoteric languages and linguistics meanwhile was proving another source of connectivity. As far back as the Shepherd Moons album, Enya named the instrumental &#8216Lothlorien&#8217 after the elven stronghold in Tolkien&#8217s fantasy Lord Of The Rings. Peter Jackson, the director of the films based on the book, reciprocated in 2001, including two songs composed and recorded by Enya in the Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Rings soundtrack, including &#8216Aniron (Theme For Aragorn And Arwen)&#8217 in The Council of Elrond sequence, with lyrics written by Roma in Sindarin. The cinematic quality of the music clearly remained undimmed.</p><p>Amarantine, released in 2005, was more classically shaded and less obviously pop influenced in its textures than its predecessors. It  further consolidated Enya&#8217s success nonetheless, especially in Japan, where she has become one of that rare breed, an international artist whose sales in Europe and the US are mirrored in the Land of the Rising Sun. It also contained a number of songs with lyrics in Loxian, a language created by Roma Ryan, which she has written about in the book Water Shows The Hidden Heart. It is perhaps a true measure of the depth of Enya&#8217s appeal that her fans are undaunted by the prospect of listening to songs sung in Japanese, Latin and Irish as well as Loxian. Even where the lyrics are abstruse, the music is shot through with a seam of beauty and yearning with which a huge number of people can identify.</p><p>There was a seasonal aspect to Enya&#8217s most recent album, And Winter Came. Originally conceived as a Christmas record, it evolved into a celebration of winter, including a reworking of &#8216Oiche Chuin&#8217 (or &#8216Silent Night&#8217), which she had first recorded in 1988. Always seen as a more time-sensitive release, less that twelve months on, it has sold almost 3 million copies, charting in over 20 countries and earning Enya a first ever No.1 in Hong Kong. But as with her previous albums there is no knowing what might spark a second wave of momentum for a record that retains the elusive combination of classical inspiration, Celtic atmosphere and pop sensibility that has defined Enya&#8217s work &#8211 and which has allowed her to stake such a unique place in the history of contemporary music, since she first exploded onto the international scene with &#8216Orinico Flow&#8217&#8230</p><p>It truly is one of the most extraordinary stories in contemporary music. In terms of success, the central protagonists have surely exceeded the wildest expectations of everyone involved when they started out on their singular journey. But to put it like that is to bypass the essential truth: that Enya the group &#8211 that is Enya, Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan &#8211 have forged a sound of remarkable originality which has captured the imagination and the loyalty of fans all over the world in the most fantastic way. Looking back to those early days and the battle they fought together to establish a foothold, in personal terms their success seems all the more heart-warming and brilliant.</p><p>There is something pure and true about what they have created in the music of Enya that defies cynicism, forging a path of integrity and making music of startling breadth and reach in the process.</p><p>My, my &#8211 as the song goes &#8211 time flies. It is 22 years since the original release of Enya and this album brings together so much of the earth-spanning music &#8211 the music of the spheres &#8211 created over those years by one of the world&#8217s biggest stars and her close friends and partners in music, Nicky and Roma Ryan. But there is still more of this to come. A lot more.</p><p>Only time will tell what new twists and turns the journey might take in the future. Of course. But to have arrived here and now, intact and still dreaming: now that is some wonderful achievement.</p>', 1988, NULL),
(195, 'Sarah McLachlan', '<p>On June 15, 2010, the Grammy Award&#8211winning singer and songwriter Sarah McLachlan will release of Laws of Illusion. This is Sarah&#8217s first studio album of new material in seven years, since the double&#8211platinum Afterglow in 2003, and its twelve songs rank with the most compelling work ever created by this gifted artist.</p><p>In the years between these two releases, Sarah has married, separated, and is raising two young daughters. These crucial life experiences have enriched her artistry and infused her new songs with the full range and complexity of adult emotions. In listening to Laws of Illusion, we can hear the strength of hard&#8211earned independence the trials of love won, lost, and found anew and the infinite joys of living.</p><p>Because Sarah&#8217s voice is so intimately familiar to so many of us, the experience of Laws of Illusion is a singular and special one. It&#8217s like meeting an old friend again after long separation &#8211 and discovering that the passage of time and the accumulation of experience have only deepened rather than diminished that friendship.</p><p>For Sarah herself, this period was a time of profound change and renewed discovery. &#8220I think when you go into a dark place for a while and you come out of it, the lightness you feel is &#8230euphoric,&#8221 she told an Advocate.com interviewer in May 2010.</p><p>&#8220My marriage collapsed a couple of years ago, and it was a long, dark road&#8230 finally coming through that knowing that life is going to be okay, life will go on, and that there&#8217s actually a possibility of love happening again is&#8230 just deliriously heady stuff.&#8221</p><p>In Laws of Illusion, Sarah looks at love &#8220from both sides now.&#8221 The opening track, &#8220Awakenings,&#8221 moves on a subdued electronic pulse underpinning ethereal guitar lines and &#8211 as the singer soars into her upper register &#8211 demonstrates her ability to craft an unforgettable &#8220hook&#8221 without hitting the listener over the head with it.</p><p>&#8220Loving You Is Easy,&#8221 the first single from the album, is an upbeat, almost jaunty piano&#8211based song, with a musical atmosphere perfectly matched to lyrics that describe the heady thrill of new love: &#8220I&#8217m alive and I&#8217m on fire/Shot like a starburst into the sky&#8230&#8221</p><p>For many listeners, &#8220Forgiveness&#8221 will be the centerpiece of Laws of Illusion. There is a wonderful subtlety in the arrangement, which builds inexorably from unaccompanied vocal&#8211and&#8211piano showcase to the layers of near&#8211ambient guitar parts and finally a powerful coda completed by bass and drums. &#8220Forgiveness,&#8221 says Sarah, &#8220is about the loss of a relationship and drawing a line in the sand, saying: This is not good for me and I can&#8217t do it anymore.&#8221</p><p>Through the years, we had it all<br/>The midnight whispers, the midday calls<br/>This house of cards, it had to fall<br/>You ask for forgiveness but you&#8217re asking too much<br/>&#8217Cos I&#8217ve sheltered my heart in a place you can&#8217t touch...</p><p>Laws of Illusion is produced by Sarah&#8217s long-time creative collaborator Pierre Marchand, and together they co&#8211wrote a number of the compositions. The sole outside number, &#8220Bring On The Wonder,&#8221 was written by English singer/songwriter Susan Enan. (In 2008, Sarah was featured on Susan&#8217s recording of this song for the television soundtrack Bones.)</p><p>&#8220Pierre and I have worked together for over twenty years,&#8221 says Sarah with a trace of awe. &#8220I co-wrote a lot with him on this record, more so than in the past.&#8221</p><p>&#8220It&#8217s an intimate thing to write [songs] with somebody, to reveal oneself like that. But I feel incredibly comfortable with him &#8211 there are no judgments. Pierre really contributed a lot to the lyrics of some of these songs. He could come up with just the right choice of words &#8211 simple but meaningful &#8211 to fit the story we were trying to tell.&#8221</p><p>Sarah and Pierre worked quickly and efficiently at their respective home studios in Vancouver and Montreal, cutting all the basic tracks for six songs in just five days. &#8220We were able to record &#8216live on the floor,&#8217 with myself and the musicians all right there in the room,&#8221 Sarah explains. &#8220It was quick and exciting, and really a first for me to work that way.&#8221</p><p>In addition to some familiar names from past McLachlan sessions, the supporting cast for Laws of Illusion includes the much&#8211traveled drummer Matt Chamberlain, who&#8217s played with everyone from Pearl Jam to John Mayer and guitarist Colin Cripps, best known for his work with Canadian singer/songwriter Kathleen Edwards. Laws of Illusion will be available both as a standard 12&#8211track compact disc and in a deluxe version including a five&#8211song bonus DVD of live in-studio performances.</p><p>Coupled with the release of Laws of Illusion comes another landmark event in Sarah McLachlan&#8217s career: her return to Lilith Fair, the all&#8211female concert tour she founded in 1997 and where once again she&#8217ll headline the main stage.</p><p>&#8220Being a part of Lilith Fair was inspiring on so many levels,&#8221 says Sarah. &#8220Besides discovering new music everyday and sharing the stage with an incredible array of talented women, it was wonderful to see established and new artists alike have the opportunity to play in front of much larger or more diverse audiences than usual.&#8221</p><p>Between 1997 and 1999, Lilith Fair drew over two million fans and raised more than $7 million for charitable causes. Now, after an eleven&#8211year hiatus, Lilith Fair is back. The 2010 edition commences June 27 in Calgary, Alberta with dates running through August 16 in Dallas, Texas. Beth Orton, Brandi Carlile, Carly Simon, Cat Power, the Go-Gos, Loretta Lynn, Jill Scott, and Mary J. Blige are just some of the artists who will join Sarah McLachlan for Lilith 2010.</p><p>&#8220This summer,&#8221 Sarah promises, &#8220is gonna be full on and fun.&#8221</p><p>The Story So Far</p><p>Since her signing with Arista Records nearly two decades ago, every one of Sarah McLachlan&#8217s studio and live albums has been certified gold, platinum, or multi-platinum by the RIAA. Touch (1988) and Solace (1991) were both gold sellers. Her 1994 breakthrough, the 3X-platinum Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, was followed by the digitally enhanced multimedia version of The Freedom Sessions (1995, gold).</p><p>&#8220I remember being $400,000 in debt and thinking, halfway through that record (laughs), &#8216Okay, the record company is going to send me home because I&#8217m just costing them so much money.&#8217</p><p>&#8220But I toured for 22 months on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, going back over and over to all these cities. And every time it would be, y&#8217know, 100 people, then 300 people, then 600 people. It was just a gentle growing thing&#8212it didn&#8217t happen overnight, and I&#8217m so grateful that it wasn&#8217t this big overnight success.&#8221</p><p>Sarah&#8217s landmark fifth album, the 10X-platinum Surfacing (1997), contained two Grammy Award-winning tracks: &#8220Building a Mystery&#8221 won for Best Female Pop Vocal and &#8220Last Dance&#8221 was voted Best Pop Instrumental. In 1998, the soundtrack for City of Angels, a film inspired by Wim Wenders&#8217 modern classic Wings of Desire, reached Number One on the Billboard chart. Featuring the Sarah McLachlan track &#8220Angel,&#8221 the City of Angels soundtrack achieved 4X platinum sales status.</p><p>The 1999 Lilith Fair tour gave rise to Sarah&#8217s 4X-platinum album Mirrorball and its platinum long-form video counterpart. &#8220I Will Remember You,&#8221 a track from Mirrorball, earned Sarah her third career Grammy Award, for Best Female Pop Vocal (1999).</p><p>&#8220Up until that point, I had managed to live my career rather quietly. I wasn&#8217t in the tabloids&#8212I still am not for the most part, thankfully. It was Lilith Fair that catapulted me into a different stratosphere as far as the media frenzy and public knowledge.</p><p>&#8220And really, at the time, it seemed like &#8216Okay, this feels right, I can manage this now&#8217&#8212whereas if that had happened six or seven years previous, I don&#8217t think I would have been anywhere near ready. But because I was able to live my career quietly and have small successes and get used to things in that way, I think I was kind of ready for it.&#8221</p><p>Afterglow, released in 2003, reached 2X-platinum status and received two Grammy Award nominations: Best Pop Vocal Album and (for the opening track &#8220Fallen&#8221) Best Female Pop Vocal.</p><p>In September 2004, Sarah McLachlan released the socially charged video &quotWorld On Fire,&quot directed by Sophie Muller. The video made what Jon Pareles, writing in the New York Times, called &#8220a modestly brilliant gesture: it stacks up budget items for a typical clip against what the same $150,000 budget would buy as relief efforts&#8212cattle, bicycles, housing, education, medicine&#8230 The contrast between show-business splurges and practical aid is startling.&#8221</p><p>&#8220World On Fire,&#8221 a Grammy nominee for Best Short Form Music Video, cost only $15 to make&#8212the price of a Sony mini DV tape. The remainder of the $150,000 video budget was distributed among eleven charitable organizations around the world including CARE, Engineers Without Borders, Help The Aged, War Child, and Heifer International.</p><p>Sarah McLachlan&#8217s Afterglow tour opened March 12, 2005 in Wellington, New Zealand and continued with dates throughout Australia, Canada, and the US&#8212including a May 24 concert at New York&#8217s Madison Square Garden The tour concluded June 12, 2005 with a gala performance in Sarah&#8217s hometown of Vancouver, BC.</p><p>In October 2006, Sarah released Wintersong, her first album of holiday-themed songs. Among the highlights of this twelve-song set: &#8220Happy Xmas (War is Over)&#8221 by John Lennon &amp Yoko Ono, &#8220Song For A Winter&#39s Night&#8221 by Gordon Lightfoot, &#8220River&#8221 by Joni Mitchell, and all-time seasonal favorites &#8220I&#39ll Be Home For Christmas&#8221 and &#8220Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.&#8221 Produced, engineered, and mixed by Pierre Marchand, the platinum-selling Wintersong reached No. 7 on the Billboard chart. The disc was nominated for both a Grammy Award (for Best Tradi&#172tional Pop Vocal Album) and a Juno Award (for Pop Album of the Year).</p><p>Sarah&#8217s many cover songs and collaborations formed the repertoire for Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff Volume 2, released April 29, 2008. The album includes her soulful interpretations of the pop classic &#8220Unchained Melody&#8221 and Lennon/McCartney&#8217s &#8220Blackbird&#8221 (from the I Am Sam soundtrack), as well as powerful live renditions of her own compositions &#8220Angel&#8221 and The Perishers&#8217 &#8220Pills.&#8221</p><p>On October 7, 2008, the artist celebrated the 20th anniversary of her multi-platinum recording career with the release of Closer: The Best Of Sarah McLachlan. For her first career anthology Closer, Sarah personally selected thirteen classic tracks from her award-winning catalog and also included two newly recorded and previously unreleased songs, &#8220U Want Me 2&#8221 and &#8220Don&#39t Give Up On Us.&#8221 Closer entered the Billboard chart at No. 11, Sarah&#8217s fifth album to reach the Billboard Top 15.</p><p>&#8220I never have set goals, in the sense that I expected to be successful or get to a certain place. My idea of success has always been, does it feel right? Does it feel good to me? Do I enjoy doing it? And somehow miraculously, I&#8217ve been able to follow that path and have a great success at it.</p><p>&#8220So this whole career, the life that I have, the opportunities that I&#8217ve been given&#8212it all comes as unexpected. Every day I pinch myself, you know? I can&#8217t believe all this has happened to me.&#8221</p><p>Sarah McLachlan married Ashwin Sood in 1997 the couple separated eleven years later. They have two daughters, India Ann (born April 6, 2002) and Taja (born June 22, 2008).</p><p>Notable Facts</p><p>&#8226 Sarah McLachlan has sold over 40 million recordings worldwide since her recording career began in 1988 with her debut album Touch.

(198, 'Robert Plant', '<p>Why is it that we&#8217re still hanging on every word Robert Plant sings? Why are his recordings so eagerly anticipated over 40 years into his career in pop music? Two reasons stand out above all others.</p><p>First: his voice. Surely the predominant element in reaching listeners, in making a connection with each individual, is a compelling voice. Plant&#8217s vocals are compelling in spades: the tone, capable of everything from heartbreaking tenderness to a trademark edginess, the phrasing that lends a distinct urgency, and, perhaps most importantly, the sense of poetry, of mystery.</p><p>The second reason for Plant&#8217s enduring ability to draw us in is that through all of these years, he&#8217s remained curious &#8211 really curious. Not content to reconstruct one of the most successful bands in the history of rock or even to stay with a particular sound for too long, Plant seems to have an unquenchable thirst for music that moves him &#8211 whether it is to be found in Northern Africa or deepest Appalachia.</p><p>Robert Plant made his first commercial recordings in 1966. In 1967, he had also formed a group called the Band of Joy, with drummer John Bonham. Soon, Bonham, Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, and bassist John Paul Jones assembled to become The New Yardbirds which became Led Zeppelin.</p><p>The Led Zeppelin era ended in 1980 when John Bonham died. Since that time, Plant has put his wide-ranging musical fascination to good use on solo albums, with Jimmy Page, and in recordings with bands like The Honeydrippers, Priory of Brion, and Strange Sensation. His performances have reflected his embrace of West Coast psychedelic rock, roots blues, African music, and traditional folk.</p><p>Plant continued to expand his horizons with 2007&#8217s Raising Sand, a collaboration with Alison Krauss. Produced by T-Bone Burnett, the album&#8217s unlikely but magnificent blend earned innumerable critical raves as well as six Grammy&#174 Awards, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year (for &#8220Please Read the Letter,&#8221 a Plant/Page song).</p><p>For Band of Joy, Plant enlisted his Raising Sand bandmate Buddy Miller as co-producer. &#8220I approached Buddy Miller because he had been lighting every room that I played in when I was with Alison &#8211 and his knowledge and his gaze he&#8217s like a curator of a rock and roll museum packed away in three or four guitar cases and you could take these guitars out and tune them accordingly...and create some juju.&#8221</p><p>Why give the album the name of one of his earliest bands? &#8220In the Band of Joy, when I was seventeen, I was playing everybody else&#8217s stuff and moving it around, and it&#8217s kind of&#8230time to reinvoke that attitude and sentiment.&#8221</p><p>Plant&#8217s overwhelming impulse was to make the music his own. &#8220I wanted to bring my personality to other people&#8217s songs and kick the door open a little bit&#8230or edge it open with my hips. I mean&#8230basically I sing the way I sing and to attack those songs in that particular way, I can only do them Plant-like, so I was thinking about Zeppelin III, I was thinking about the mixture of acoustic and powerful electric.&#8221</p><p>The band &#8211 Darrell Scott (acoustic guitar, mandolin, octave mandolin, banjo, accordion, pedal steel and lap steel guitar), Byron House (bass), Marco Giovino (drums and percussion), and Miller (electric guitar, baritone, 6-string bass, mandoguitar) &#8211 goes right to work, providing an irresistible groove for the opening track, Los Lobos&#8217 &#8220Angel Dance.&#8221 The Middle Eastern melody that accompanies the chorus is a reminder of Plant&#8217s far-flung influences. Richard Thompson&#8217s &#8220House of Cards&#8221 follows and updates the folk-rock sound of British bands like Fairport Convention and Pentangle. Plant calls Thompson &#8220Another music nut,&#8221 and pronounces the song &#8220so good and so finite the lyric is superb.&#8221<br/>&#8220Central Two-O-Nine&#8221 by Plant and Miller is an acoustic tune with a chant-like chorus. &#8220It&#8217s a bit like &#8220Hats Off To Harper&#8221 on Led Zeppelin III &#8211 it&#8217s a throwaway of every great blues line I could think of at the time.&#8221</p><p>&#8220Silver Rider&#8221 and &#8220Monkey&#8221 from the husband/wife group Low are the closest this album comes to replicating the ethereal blend of Raising Sand. This time Plant&#8217s partner is Patty Griffin, whose voice meets his with a tone he describes as &#8220something between This Mortal Coil and the Shangri-Las.&#8221 Whatever it is, it works, as Plant and Griffin use these two songs to create a delicate, enigmatic mood.</p><p>Plant found Barbara Lynn&#8217s recording of &#8220You Can&#8217t Buy My Love&#8221 on a giveaway CD from the Oxford magazine compilation &#8220and it was just cute. It is a pop song. So I just pushed in a kind of little &#8216ooh ooh&#8217 bridge and Patty just got her personality around it and we kicked ass. It comes out of a cupboard that your uncle might have closed up in 1963 you open the door and it comes roaring out.&#8221</p><p>The same era gives us &#8220I&#8217m Falling in Love Again,&#8221 originally recorded by The Kelly Brothers. &#8220I don&#8217t know whether it was the Anglo-Saxon aspect in the room but it moved into a Honeydrippers country cousins song&#8230and the thing that it does probably best of all is it brings in other voices. I really wanted this record to be A Band of Joy &#8211 you hear voices all around my voice. I&#8217ve been spoiled I think in the past with Stuart Duncan and Buddy singing and Alison&#8230I&#8217ve gotten really used to hearing voices around the voice.&#8221 The voices around the voice here (Buddy Miller and Darrell Scott) sound like a Southern Gospel quartet and give the track a classic country feel.</p><p>&#8220The Only Sound That Matters&#8221 has an easygoing feeling, but that doesn&#8217t diminish how important its theme is to Robert Plant. &#8220I think that the thrill of hearing people &#8216mean it&#8217 is one of the greatest gifts, just to be arrested by somebody, by some group of people who really, really mean it&#8230you hear a great lyric and you go wow, (&#8216the only sound that matters,&#8217 is what you need)&#8230and the theory behind the lyric is great.&#8221</p><p>Plant and Miller based their version of the classic folk song &#8220Cindy I&#8217ll Marry You Someday&#8221 on a recording by folklorist Bascom Lamar Lunsford. The song may be the most basic folk song on the album, but it played a pivotal role in achieving the right sound. &#8220&#8230We all found our common world, three hours into the session. I mean we started off probably in the toughest place by starting off with &#8216Cindy I&#8217ll Marry You Someday&#8217&#8230I had to bring Me into the performance, but at the same time I had to find out where the band might take it to&#8230what might happen. So, once we were on a roll the personality and the character of the combination of musicians got stronger and stronger&#8230&#8221</p><p>Plant interprets Townes Van Zant&#8217s reflective &#8220Harm&#8217s Swift Way&#8221 as an almost anthemic rock song. &#8220I heard the version that Townes recorded and it was kinda like a demo. And again the lyric is dumbfounding &#8211 it just wipes you out completely. His delivery was quite disturbing, if you like. It was like the last demo you make before you put the guitar down and never pick it up again, ever. Was just like the end of everything. And it was very mournful and dirge-like and I just thought well there may be another way of doing this because the lyric is strong and maybe we can turn it into something that actually is, not a monument to him, but just another reflection of his work.&#8221</p><p>To close out the album, the very spare arrangement and pleading vocal of the old-time country song &#8220Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down&#8221 is followed by a driving, almost psychedelic version of a mid-19th century poem &#8220Even This Shall Pass Away.&#8221 The two songs harken back &#8211 or should I say forward &#8211 to Robert Plant&#8217s astonishing musical legacy.</p><p>It&#8217s 2010 and we&#8217re hanging on every word.</p>', 1982, NULL),
(199, 'Brandi Carlile', '<p>Brandi Carlile&#39s third album, Give Up The Ghost, unveils her talents in their truest form. After two albums and non-stop touring, she has let her guard down and offers her most candid recording to date. If the phrase &quotgive up the ghost&quot most often refers to death or dying, it can also be used to describe the passing of stages in life, of transformation.</p><p>&quotTo give up the ghost is not just to die since we do it a handful of times throughout our lives. It&#39s a sort of leaving yourself behind,&quot she explains. &quotOr what you knew yourself to be so that you can grow and transcend love or youth. Sometimes both.&quot</p><p>The recording of Give Up The Ghost offered new experiences including working with the likes of Elton John, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers multi-instrumentalist Benmont Tench, drummer Chad Smith and Amy Ray of The Indigo Girls, all of whom contribute to the album.</p><p>For Carlile, the album is one of extremes: &quotThe songs that are stripped down, raw and bare are that way so it makes the listener feel a little uncomfortable,&quot she says. &quotAnd the ones that are huge are really big, with big harmonies, piano, layering electric guitar solos and a string arrangement like at the end of &#39Pride and Joy.&#39&quot</p><p>After debuting with her self-titled album in 2005, the Washington State-bred Carlile saw her fanbase mushroom with her sophomore disc, The Story, in 2007. Among the growing legion of Carlile fans is Elton John. &quotBrandi has an amazing voice,&quot he says. &quotShe&#39s a great songwriter and has a tremendous career ahead of her.&quot Proudly, Carlile says that John - who duets with her on the song, &quotCaroline&quot - played a key a role in her evolution as an artist: &quotI&#39ve been listening to country and western music my whole life and I was totally immersed in Grand Ole Opry culture, wherein the entertainers are usually not the ones who wrote the music. But when I was 11 and discovered Elton John, I realized that performers do write and perform their own songs, and I immediately went out and got a keyboard and started writing.&quot When they recorded together, &quotI was just overwhelmed by the years, and by the influence that somebody can have on another person&#39s life without even knowing it.&quot</p><p>&quotCaroline,&quot a playful song inspired by her niece, is one of several songs riddled with confidence and proudly wearing the influence of Carlile&#39s recent studio and stage success. Elsewhere, the sparse &quotIf There Was No You,&quot and the passionate, open-hearted &quotLooking Out&quot are simple, spirited love letters. On &quotThat Year,&quot Carlile remembers a friend who committed suicide while they were both teenagers. She had a dream about that friend, which led to the song: &quotSomething like that never really leaves you. At that age, you might not have the coping skills to really understand.&quot</p><p>Give Up The Ghost was recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, birthplace of legendary recordings by The Doors and Led Zeppelin. The first single, &quotDreams,&quot was written with her longtime bandmates, twin brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth (on guitar and bass, respectively - Carlile&#39s band also features cellist Josh Neumann). &quotThe twins and I sat together in a circle and wrote &#39Dreams&#39 acoustically, with three-part harmonies. We put all of our energy into and it, and played it on the road for a year. But when it came time to record it with a drummer, we couldn&#39t get it right. It wasn&#39t sounding as energetic as it was supposed to. So we decided to just record it as the three of us. But, unbeknownst to us, in the other room, drums were being recorded as we were playing. It worked - we didn&#39t end up changing the way we play it.&quot</p><p>If she took root in performing songs by the likes of Patsy Cline as a child, Carlile&#39s journey to places like Sunset Sound gained traction during her teen years when she first started playing in bands. Eventually, she and the Hanseroth twins recorded a collection of songs, for which they had modest hopes. To their surprise, those songs became Brandi Carlile, which sold more than 120,000 copies and spawned the popular single &quotWhat Can I Say.&quot</p><p>Her second album, The Story, upped the ante considerably, selling 313,000 copies and rising to No. 41 on the Billboard albums chart, and boasting songs like the title track and &quotTurpentine.&quot Several of Carlile&#39s songs have appeared in commercials and on televisions shows such as Grey&#39s Anatomy. Along the way, she has toured with the likes of Ray LaMontagne, and Sheryl Crow, who raved about Carlile&#39s support performances online: &quotShe has the most amazing voice I may have ever heard. Soulful. Country. Perfect in every way-and propelled by taste.&quot</p><p>With all that encouragement and experience under her belt, when Carlile set out to make Give Up The Ghost, she did so with ample ambition: &quotWhen we recorded The Story, we set up our instruments with one drummer, like a stage, and we treated the record like a show, and we recorded that performance. This is this is the first time we treated something like a record. We really dug in and created an environment specifically for each song. We didn&#39t go halfway on anything.&quot</p>', 2004, NULL);

(200, 'Darius Rucker', '<p>Having your first country album debut at #1 on the Billboard charts &#8211 following a multi-week #1 debut country single &#8211 is a huge achievement by anyone&#8217s measure. When you add to that the New York Times&#8217 claim that your debut album is &#8220one of the year&#8217s most vibrant country albums,&#8221 and Variety&#8217s declaration that &#8220Country music has a new major star, and the genre may never be the same&#8221 &#8211 well, it can be pretty heady stuff.</p><p>So it comes as no surprise that Capitol Records Nashville artist Darius Rucker is delighted by the critical and commercial success of his first country album, LEARN TO LIVE, and very proud of the #1 single, &#8220Don&#8217t Think I Don&#8217t Think About It&#8221 &#8211 on which Rucker was a co-writer. And his delight only increased as his second single, &#8220It Won&#8217t Be Like This For Long,&#8221 also landed atop all three country singles charts.</p><p>However, what Darius Rucker mostly feels these days is grateful . . . Grateful that the millions of fans that knew Rucker as the voice of Hootie &amp The Blowfish, the Grammy-winning group whose album CRACKED REAR VIEW sold more than 16 million copies, happily followed the singer/songwriter in his natural evolution to country music. Grateful that hundreds of country radio programmers embraced him as a welcome addition to the genre &#8211 as did the nation&#8217s countless country music fans. . . Grateful that Nashville songwriters and established country artists have recognized him as one of their own . . . Grateful that he has been embraced by media and invited to perform on The Late Show, The Tonight Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, and more . . . And finally, grateful that, as a seasoned performer who has already experienced the fickle highs and lows of fame, he&#8217s grounded and secure enough these days to truly appreciate this new phase in his music career.</p><p>With the critically-acclaimed LEARN TO LIVE, the listener realizes that this project is steeped in the country traditions of meaningful lyrics and resonant melodies, yet is still an album that sounds completely modern.</p><p>And, as the best country albums do, LEARN TO LIVE takes the listener on a voyage through life&#8217s experiences. The album&#8217s arc covers major life themes such as falling in love, birth and death. &#8220This CD is a journey,&#8221 Rucker says. &#8220I realized I&#8217m 42. I&#8217m not going to write many songs about drinking, chasing girls or booty calls. I was going to write songs about having kids and stuff - songs about life.&#8221</p><p>Guests on the album include Brad Paisley on the humorous &#8220All I Want&#8221 and Vince Gill and Alison Krauss on the inspirational &#8220If I Had Wings.&#8221 &#8220To me, he&#8217s one of the best guitar players around,&#8221 Rucker says. Gill and Krauss made Rucker, the ultimate fan, dizzy with delight: &#8220They sounded like angels. You have these two artists singing on top of my voice . . . it gave me chills.&#8221</p><p>Rucker has always had a close kinship to country music and country artists. &#8220Growing up in South Carolina, it was always around, always on the radio,&#8221 he says. First a fan of Buck Owens, Rucker naturally gravitated towards Dwight Yoakam, New Grass Revival and Radney Foster in his twenties. &#8220When I first heard Radney&#8217s voice on Foster &amp Lloyd&#8217s &#8216Crazy Over You,&#8217 I thought, &#8216this guy&#8217s voice is bigger than Texas.&#8217 I&#8217m thinking, &#8216this is cool songwriting.&#8217 &#8221</p><p>Fans of the Hootie &amp The Blowfish - many of whom had already made the natural migration from pop to country radio - realize that the band&#8217s catchy songs were rooted in the same elements that make great country music. In fact, Rucker says, &#8220We talked about being a country band, and I just got outvoted! They also used to kid me about how I always was bringing them country songs that they had to turn into rock songs . . .&#8221   Therefore, making his first country CD was not so much a big leap for Rucker as simply a slight shift in Rucker&#8217s musical evolution. As Billboard magazine noted, &#8220There&#8217s a sense of purpose that makes Rucker feel like a member of the country family, rather than an interloper&#8230 Sounds like country may have a shining new star.&#8221</p><p>As a student of great songwriting, Rucker earned his advanced degree while working on LEARN TO LIVE. &#8220Writing with those songwriters was like going to Songwriting University,&#8221 he says. His professors/co-writers included such legendary writers as Rivers Rutherford (Brad Paisley, Tim McGraw, Gretchen Wilson) Frank Rogers (Brad Paisley, Trace Adkins) and Clay Mills (Diamond Rio, Reba McEntire). &#8220So many people in pop try to write all these psychedelic crazy lyrics, and I&#8217m sure I&#8217ve been part of that - but that&#8217s something you don&#8217t find in country music. The thing I like most about country songs is that they keep it simple. I love that, and I love the melodies.&#8221</p><p>Fellow South Carolina native Rogers also served as the album&#8217s producer, a job he secured immediately after meeting Rucker: &#8220In the first 30 minutes, we wrote &#8216All I Want.&#8217 The label asked if I wanted to meet the other [potential producers] and I said, &#8216Never mind. I met my guy&#8217.&#8221</p><p>The success of first single, the bittersweet &#8220Don&#8217t Think I Don&#8217t Think About It,&#8221 shows that Rucker had country fans at hello. The single, co-written by Rucker with Clay Mills, soared to number one at radio even more quickly than anticipated. &#8220It just breaks your heart,&#8221 says Rucker of the song. &#8220And it was country enough that it wouldn&#8217t be perceived as me being pop and just putting fiddle on a song.&#8221</p><p>That song and the universal emotion it evokes typifies the stripped-bare nature of LEARN TO LIVE. &#8220I want people to take away a sense of realness,&#8221 Rucker says. &#8220I want everybody to find a song on it that they can relate to and go, &#8216Wow, I did that, too.&#8217 &#8221</p><p>For Rucker, the welcome mat that country radio has laid out for him has been extraordinarily gratifying. &#8220The reception has been unbelievable,&#8221 he says. But smart programmers know that teens raised on Hootie are now confirmed country listeners, so hearing Rucker is like hearing an old friend. &#8220People listen to country music because they know it&#8217s where you can find songs.&#8221</p><p>Rucker&#8217s solo career is taking center stage, and he is devoted to promoting LEARN TO LIVE.  Rucker will soon be launching a third single from the album, &#8220Alright.&#8221</p><p>&#8220You know, I had been in that rock cocoon for a while . . . But now I get to come out and sing these songs,&#8221 says Darius Rucker.  &#8220I plan to be doing this for a long time.  This isn&#8217t a one album deal &#8211 it&#8217s a career thing.&#8221</p>', 2008, NULL),
(201, 'Evanescence', '<p>Having sold nearly 14 million records worldwide, well more than 6 million in the U.S. alone, with their major-label debut Fallen, Evanescence is poised to continue their meteoric rise with their forthcoming CD, The Open Door (Wind-up Records), scheduled for release October 3.  The album from the two-time Grammy-winning band is defined by Amy Lee&#8217s beautiful melodies, compelling lyrics, poignant piano and stunning vocals, fused with Terry Balsamo&#8217s urgent, yet intricate guitar, to form a seamless, ethereal mixture that perfectly channels the band&#8217s hard rock and classical sensibilities.  The contributions of members John LeCompt (guitar) and Rocky Gray (drums) are also evident.</p><p>&#8220Making this record has been really intense,&#8221 explains Lee.  &#8220Terry suffered a stroke last October and is still recovering, we got a new manager [Andy Lurie], and I&#8217ve come out of a difficult breakup.  But everything we&#8217ve been through together has benefited this album.&#8221  With Fallen, says Lee, the band had much to prove while defining its identity.  This time, finding a cohesive writing partner in Terry Balsamo, &#8220we really took our time crafting this album and had the freedom to express a broader range of emotions: not just pain and sadness, but also anger and, yes, even happiness.&#8221</p><p>Written late last year, The Open Door was recorded at The Record Plant in Los Angeles and mixed at Ocean Way Studios in March 2006.  Marking the return of long-time friend and producer Dave Fortman, the album&#8217s musical elements include a classically-infused choir and strings on several tracks, giving further color to songs of introspection, longing, doubt, self-respect and, ultimately, empowerment.  The album opens with &#8220Sweet Sacrifice,&#8221 a post-relationship catharsis that head-dives from an otherworldly intro into a hard-driving thrash of hard rock guitars and soaring rock vocals.  Its first single, the mid-tempo &#8220Call Me When You&#8217re Sober,&#8221 reinforces the moving-away-from-dysfunction theme.</p><p>Other standout tracks on The Open Door include &#8220Lithium,&#8221 which embraces feeling over numbness, &#8220All That I&#8217m Living For,&#8221 Lee&#8217s tribute to band life, &#8220Weight of the World,&#8221 her plea for perspective from the expectation of young fans, and &#8220Good Enough,&#8221 a string-and-choir-infused closer distinguished as the band&#8217s first truly (almost) contented song (&#8220It feels really good ending the album this way,&#8221 says Lee).  Having toured for a year-and-a-half straight with only a month off following the release of Fallen, Evanescence hopes to hit the road this time out with a care not to neglect key markets worldwide.  Its U.S. tour begins immediately after the October 3 debut of The Open Door, rewarding hardcore fans with a  &#8220sneak peak&#8221 at the album handful of more intimate theater dates before segueing into much larger arena shows.</p><p>Originally hailing from Little Rock, Arkansas, the band&#8217s evolving sound &#8211 a nearly mystical marriage between rock, goth and classical &#8211 was informed by a curious duality.  Lee, who spent nine years studying classical piano, explains, &#8220When I was in high school I listened to a lot of death metal bands.  Both genres are intricate, complex types of music that are very dramatic, and I&#8217m naturally drawn to that.&#8221</p><p>Evanescence self-released two EPs and a first full-length album, the much-sought-after Origin, before finding a home at Wind-up Records.  Fallen, their major-label debut, was released in April 2003 to critical and commercial success.  The internationally appealing Top 10 singles &#8220Bring Me to Life&#8221 and &#8220My Immortal&#8221 helped drive airplay and led to two 2003 Grammy Awards (Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance for &#8220Bring Me To Life&#8221).  Propelling the band to sales of nearly 14 million albums worldwide, Fallen spent more than 100 weeks on Billboard&#8217s Top 200 chart, was certified gold or platinum in over 35 countries, and sold out arenas globally.  Anywhere But Home, their 2004 live DVD release, has sold over one million copies to date.</p><p>The inherent drama in Evanescence&#8217s music &#8211 a kind of audio odyssey that can turn on a dime from piano-led introspection to hammering guitar &#8211 has resonated with listeners everywhere.  The band&#8217s aggressive core finds a counterpart in Lee&#8217s passionate vocals, lyrics that forge a connection with audiences searching for identity or struggling with feelings of desire, hope love and loss.  The Open Door is a logical (but certainly not predictable) transformation of epic proportions for the band, which, in many ways has only just begun to make its mark on the music world.</p>', 2003, NULL),
(202, 'Three Days Grace', '<p>When it came time to choose an album title for the follow-up to Three Days Grace&#8217s 2006&#8217s platinum-certified One-X, the four band members thought the phrase &#8220life starts now&#8221 summed things up pretty well. &#8220The new album is basically a commentary on the last couple years of our lives,&#8221 says drummer Neil Sanderson. &#8220Things have been fairly traumatic for more than one of us. We&#8217ve all had to confront death on a few different levels, and we&#8217ve had family go through some health-related things, so, for us, Life Starts Now reflects that feeling of redefining what life is and what it means to be alive after you hit rock bottom.&#8221</p><p>&#8220The events of the past few years have made us more aware of what life really can be,&#8221 says lead vocalist/guitarist Adam Gontier. &#8220So the album is about taking the situation that you&#8217re in, no matter how bad it feels, and making the best of it. Lyrically, most of the songs are based around that idea.&#8221</p><p>Several tracks address powerful feelings of loss whether through betrayal, on &#8220Bitter Taste&#8221 and &#8220Last To Know,&#8221 or death, on &#8220World So Cold&#8221 and &#8220Without You&#8221 &#8212 songs that bassist Brad Walst says &#8220really hit close to home.&#8221 &#8220Bully&#8221 tackles the impact of bullying, something Sanderson describes as &#8220a massive problem that can actually change someone&#8217s life and affect who they are as a person.&#8221 The band switches things up on the more upbeat &#8220The Good Life,&#8221 which asks: &#8220If you were to live a different life, what would you want to get out of it?&#8221 Gontier explains. Then there&#8217s the fiery first single &#8220Break,&#8221 which Gontier says explores not being controlled by your surroundings or environment. &#8220It&#8217s about breaking away from being told what to do and living the life that you want to live.&#8221</p><p>A sense of adventure permeates Life Starts Now, which the Toronto-based band began writing after coming off the road for One-X in April 2008. Though the album doesn&#8217t skimp on Gontier&#8217s trademark anguished vocals, Barry Stock&#8217s urgent riffs, or Sanderson and Walst&#8217s thunderous rhythm section, the band knew that they had evolved as musicians, thanks to hundreds of live shows, and wanted to capture it in their sound. &#8220While touring behind One-X, we&#8217d try new things at soundchecks and experiment a bit,&#8221 recalls Walst, &#8220but we had a bigger vision for this record. We wanted to do something a little different.&#8221</p><p>&#8220We had talked about how so many contemporary rock records have that formulaic, heavily layered, mechanical, shiny sound to them,&#8221 Sanderson says. &#8220They start sounding generic and fake. So we wanted to go the opposite route and freshen things up by making a record that was really open and raw and live. That&#8217s how we approached it&#8212we went for that big, boomy sound.&#8221 To get it, Three Days Grace recorded Life Starts Now at The Warehouse Studios in Vancouver, where everyone from AC/DC to Bon Jovi to Nine Inch Nails have recorded, and which Sanderson describes as having one &#8220the best open drum rooms in the world.&#8221</p><p>They also prepped themselves in advance. &#8220Before we went into the studio, we&#8217d listen to classic rock records by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, just to remember the sounds that we loved while we were growing up,&#8221 Gontier says. &#8220We wanted to make our album sound very real, raw, and larger-than-life, like those old records do.&#8221 Adds lead guitarist Barry Stock, &#8220Everybody seemed to feel a little freer to expand and do something beyond the regular cookie-cutter thing, so we all just stepped it up. There are some great solos, some great drum parts, and great vocal moments. We&#8217re inspired by classic rock bands more than anything because they have this really great organic feel, but they sound huge, and we wanted to achieve that.&#8221</p><p>To help them reach their goals, Three Days Grace reunited with producer Howard Benson (My Chemical Romance, Motorhead, Papa Roach, P.O.D), who produced One-X. &#8220He really saw our vision and let us experiment to get the sounds and parts we needed to make the best record we could,&#8221 Walst says. &#8220One of the great things about Howard is that he recognizes what kind of band we are,&#8221 Sanderson adds. &#8220He really complements what we do and is definitely a great guy to bounce ideas off of.&#8221</p><p>The result is an album that brims with confidence, musicality, and accessibility, while retaining what has made Three Days Grace so beloved by their fans: their authenticity. &#8220I think people relate to our music on such a deep level because we&#8217re real,&#8221 says Gontier. &#8220We write about real things and I think people know that. Our fans know that we&#8217re not trying to be something that we&#8217re not.&#8221 Adds Sanderson: &#8220People can connect what we write about to their own lives because it&#8217s real. We&#8217ve been dealt hands that have been difficult, but I think these days, people want something real more than ever, and they&#8217re especially sensitive to what is contrived and what isn&#8217t.&#8221</p><p>It&#8217s that genuineness, along with emotional themes underscored by their explosive sound and that has led Three Days Grace to rock stardom. Their 2003 self-titled debut spawned three hit singles, &#8220I Hate Everything About You,&#8221 which reached #2 on the Mediabase Modern Rock chart and went Top 5 on the Mediabase Mainstream Rock chart. &#8220Just Like You&#8221 climbed to #1 on both the Mediabase Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts, while &#8220Home&#8221 peaked at #2 on the Mediabase Mainstream Rock chart. One-X debuted on the Billboard album chart at #5 and produced three #1 Mediabase Mainstream Rock singles: &#8220Animal I&#8217ve Become,&#8221 &#8220Pain&#8221 and &#8220Never Too Late.&#8221 In 2007, Mediabase ranked the band as the #1 artist in airplay across all rock formats (Modern Rock, Active Rock, Mainstream Rock). Also that year, R&ampR/Billboard ranked Three Days Grace as the #1 Active Rock Artist of the Year, #1 Rock Artist of the Year, and #2 Modern Rock/Alternative Artist of the Year. Both Three Days Grace and One-X have been certified platinum by the RIAA and the band has sold more than six million albums worldwide. In 2008, they wrapped up more than two years of touring in the U.S., where they shared stages with fellow rockers Nickelback, Staind, Seether, and Breaking Benjamin.</p><p>Now Three Days Grace are looking forward to following up those successes with Life Starts Now, which was released by Jive Records on September 22, 2009. &#8220I&#8217m curious to see how people respond to it and what songs they relate to,&#8221 Gontier says. &#8220Music is emotion for us,&#8221 adds Walst. &#8220We&#8217re just trying to trust our own gut. If the four of us feel something while we&#8217re playing it, then we hope our fans relate and feel the same.&#8221</p><p>&#8220Even though we wanted this album to be different, there&#8217s a lot that hasn&#8217t changed,&#8221 says Sanderson. &#8220We still use music as a way to release emotion. The other thing that hasn&#8217t changed is the best part of it all: getting up on stage and killing it in front of 20,000 people!&#8221</p>', 2003, NULL),
(203, 'Shinedown', '<p>Early in 2007, producer Rob Cavallo asked Shinedown frontman Brent Smith about his goals for the band&#39s new album. Smith didn&#39t hesitate.</p><p>&quotI said, &#39You know what -- when I&#39m dead and gone, when everybody in this band has passed or what have you, I want the world to remember this as a record that needed to be made, and that there was a reason for it,&#39 &quot Smith says. &quotThat was the motivation behind this album.&#8221</p><p>&quotAnd part of the reason it took so long to make!&quot</p><p>Welcome then to THE SOUND OF MADNESS, Shinedown&#39s third album -- and the Florida rockers&#39 boldest effort to date. Like its two predecessors, 2003&#39s Platinum LEAVE A WHISPER and 2005&#39s Gold US AND THEM, THE SOUND OF MADNESS offers a brave and unsparing look into the soul and psyche amidst a fierce musical attack that, even in its quieter moments, vibrate with the passion, energy and focus of a band with high-minded ideals and limitless ambitions.</p><p>Smith and company began the recording process for THE SOUND OF MADNESS with the formidable task of following up two massively successful albums that yielded a staggering seven consecutive Top five rock and alternative radio hits that included &quotFly From the Inside,&quot  &quot45,&quot the chart topping &quotSave Me,&quot and a cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd&#39s &quotSimple Man,&quot along with a reputation as a hot live band with an insatiable appetite for the road. However, after one listen, it&#8217s clear that the band didn&#39t shrink from the task.  Where THE SOUND OF MADNESS differs most is in its growth it&#8217s the product of a group that has developed an even clearer vision for how it wanted to impact an audience.</p><p>&quotLyrically, these songs are the most blunt that I&#39ve ever written,&quot says Smith, who formed Shinedown with drummer Barry Kerch in 2001 in Jacksonville, Fla. &quotI feel that on this record I wrote what a lot of people want to say, but they just don&#39t know how to say it -- not that I should tell anyone how to live their lives, but I&#39ve had these experiences and these thoughts that are in my head.  And I can&#39t believe I&#39m the only one who feels the way I do. So I just tried to express that in the most artistic and the most honest way I possibly could.&quot</p><p>On THE SOUND OF MADNESS, Smith and Shinedown express those thoughts and ideas in ways they never have before. The group&#39s hard rock muscles flex on songs such as the first single, &quotDevour,&quot &quotCry For Help,&quot &quotSin With a Grin&quot and the title track. But the likes of &quotThe Crow and the Butterfly,&quot &quotBreaking Inside&quot and their latest single &quotSecond Chance&quot incorporate more sophisticated, emotional dynamics (enhanced by a 20-piece string section), while Smith counts &quotIf You Only Knew&quot as his first straight-up love song.</p><p>&quotA long time ago I said, &#39I&#39ll never write a love song. I&#39m not that guy,&#39 &quotSmith recalls with a laugh. &quotI just never had a reason to write a love song before.  But this song was written the day that I found out that I was going to be a father.  My son has given me a whole different perspective on things, especially love.&quot</p><p>THE SOUND OF MADNESS also contains Smith&#39s first-ever political song &#8220Devour,&#8221 which he says was inspired by Shinedown&#39s visits to troops in Iraq and his feelings about the end of George W. Bush&#39s presidency.</p><p>&quotI won&#39t lie I got really angry,&quot Smith explains about the first single. &quotThis is my statement to him &#39This is the end of your presidency, and this is what you have to show for it&#39 -- Not that everything he did was bad or wrong. I don&#39t want to get too political, because I&#39m not a political person. But after coming back from Iraq, I just had to write that song and get it out of my system.&quot</p><p>Elsewhere on THE SOUND OF MADNESS, listeners will find Shinedown waxing autobiographically (&quotSecond Chance&quot is about Smith leaving his native Knoxville, Tenn., to pursue a career in rock &#39n&#39 roll &quotWhat a Shame&quot is an elegy to a beloved late uncle) but also crafting insightful observations gleaned from the hundreds of shows and millions of road miles the band has logged.</p><p>&quotIn the seven years of this thing called Shinedown,&quot Smith says, &quotI&#39ve seen a lot of different things - what we&#39ve all gone through on the road, things in our personal lives or witnessed firsthand through the fans that we&#39ve made and the relationships we&#39ve built with our audience. I think the biggest thing was I didn&#39t want to sugarcoat the way life can be sometimes. This is my viewpoint. This is my view of every day life.&quot</p><p>Kerch, meanwhile, says THE SOUND OF MADNESS succeeds most in putting some sonic power behind the power of Smith&#39s expression.</p><p>&quotWe wanted to come out of the gate crushing,&quot the drummer explains. &quotWe really wanted to make a statement with this record and make it bigger than life -- a big rock album that made a statement that, &#39Alright, we&#39re back. This is our third record, and this is what we&#39re about.&#8221</p><p>By the time Shinedown first met with producer Rob Cavallo -- whose own Grammy award winning, multi-platinum track record includes work with Green Day, My Chemical Romance, the Goo Goo Dolls and Kid Rock -- the frontman had a number of songs already together and further dazzled the producer by improvising a new composition during their discussion.</p><p>&quotI was just taken with (Smith),&quot Cavallo says. &quotHe was really just on fire to do well. He&#39s a guy driven to win. He wants to make the best record he can make and spent a lot of time writing ...making sure it all mattered.&quot</p><p>Cavallo, meanwhile, entered THE SOUND OF MADNESS with his own agenda for Shinedown&#39s next step.</p><p>&quotI thought they definitely had a greater potential than the success they&#39d already achieved,&quot he explains. There&#39s no reason a guy with that voice and intensity shouldn&#39t be able to go all the way. We decided to make sure that the songs had that potential.&quot</p><p>Smith heard the message loud and clear. He left the first meeting with Cavallo and returned with nearly 60 songs by the fall, when Shinedown entered the studio in Los Angeles. The group wound up recording 15, including some -- such as &quotCry For Help&quot -- that were written in the studio during the recording process.</p><p>All the while, however, Smith says that Shinedown &quotwanted it loud and wanted it big and heavy and grandiose. For the heavy songs, we wanted it as heavy as it could be, but using different kinds of styles with a lot of different guitar tones.&quot Incorporating synthesizers and the aforementioned strings, Smith notes that, &quotwe used a lot of really unique sounds and different variations underneath the music that you wouldn&#39t necessarily know were there, but, if they were gone, you&#39d miss them.&quot</p><p>Kerch says Cavallo&#39s role in helping attain that layered sound cannot be understated. &quotHe brought to the table not only knowledge of music in general but a lot of patience and a real comfortable environment,&quot Kerch recalls. &quotHe would sit on the couch and we&#39d be playing a take and he&#39d pop up and go, &#39Oh fuck!  This is what we have to do!&#39 and come out and literally show us. He was so energetic and made everybody want to do better.&quot</p><p>That bigger sound on the album is mirrored in the new lineup of Shinedown, a revamped edition of the band that, along with drummer Kerch (or &#8216the almighty Barry Kerch&#8217 as Smith likes to say), includes Eric Bass on bass and former touring guitarist Zach Myers as a permanent fixture.</p><p>&quotAll of a sudden it started growing into this other thing,&quot Smith says. &quotThese guys are brilliant, brilliant players. It&#39s a reinvention, and it&#39s stronger.&quot</p><p>Smith plans to take keep this &quotnew reincarnation&quot of Shinedown on the road for quite awhile, too, making sure THE SOUND OF MADNESS is heard worldwide. A justifiable pride in the album as well as a growing international fan base for the band will lead to an even further evolution in which the record that &quotneeded&quot to be made will similarly need to be heard in a live setting.</p><p>&quotI sometimes look at Shinedown as an entity unto itself,&quot Smith says. &quotIt keeps evolving all the time, like it actually has a heartbeat. It&#39s not a machine there&#39s actually blood flowing through it. From the time we came up with the name, it&#39s felt like it&#39s conducting us and flowing through us. It&#39s weird -- but it&#39s pretty wonderful, too.&quot</p>', 2005, NULL),

(205, 'Alice In Chains', '<p>Alice in Chains(Formed in 1987, by guitarist Jerry Cantrell bassist Mike Starr, drummer Sean Kinney and Vocalist Layne Staley) is one of the most influential American rock bands in the early 90&#39s. Drawing equally from the heavy riffing of metal and the gloomy strains of post-punk, the band developed a bleak sound that balanced grinding metal riffs with subtly textured acoustic numbers. They were hard enough for metal fans than their dark subject and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the best Seattle-based grunge bands.</p><p>By combining the unique voice and intense delivery of Layne Staley with evocative songwriting and vocal harmonies of Cantrell Alice in Chains created an immediately identifiable sound that also proved to be quite diverse as their repertoire grew to include both driving angry rock songs and mellow acoustic compositions.</p><p>The band found commercial and artistic success in the early 90&#39s, which stressed Staley&#39s increasingly clear abuse of heroin. They often found their attempts to follow up the success in the studio or on the road to be hampered by Staley&#39s erratic drug-fueled behavior.  Ultimately, Alice in Chains failed to maintain a consistent career in the post-grunge music world and limped into the break when Cantrell turned its attention to solo projects (which often include contributions from Kinney and Inez) Staley finally succumbed to his grief when he overdosed in April 2002</p><p>Jerry Cantrell Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reformed and played shows in late 2005 and early 2006 with a variety of guest vocalists including Billy Corgan, Pat Lachman, Wes Scantlin, Maynard James Keenan, Ann Wilson and Phil Anselmo. In Late 2006 William DuVall joined Alice in Chains as a singer in the band&#39s reunion concert with Velvet Revolver and ex-Guns N &#39Roses bassist Duff McKagan.

(206, 'Five Finger Death Punch', '<p>Five Finger Death Punch are ready for battle.</p><p>Their forthcoming sophomore album, War Is the Answer, is locked and loaded with twelve tracks of raw epic heavy metal. Releasing September 22nd 2009 via Prospect Park/EMI, the record&#39s deafening battle cry will undoubtedly rattle the genre to its very core and pull listeners deep into this War.  Many were surprised to see the meteoric yet steady rise that 5FDP undertook in the last two year, and that was just the beginning.</p><p>5FDP have embarked on quite the journey to reach this point.  The Los Angeles quintet&#39s assault on heavy music began in 2007 with the release of their hit debut The Way of the Fist. After forming a &#8220dream team&#8221 of metal musicians, the band self-funded the album- producing it entirely themselves.  Death Punch eventually signed with The Firm/ Prospect Park.  After months of relentless touring&#8212including a show-stealing set at 2008&#8217s Mayhem Festival&#8212Five Finger Death Punch became the hottest new band in metal.</p><p>Hot as hell, in fact: sales for Fist have exceeded 335,000 in the U.S. alone, while Death Punch grabbed features in publications such as Revolver, Kerrang!, Guitar World, Billboard and Metal Hammer. Plus, Fist spawned three top ten singles on active rock radio&#8212&quotThe Bleeding,&quot &quotNever Enough,&quot and &quotStranger Than Fiction.&quot Each single grew very organically in popularity, inexplicably turning a metal band into one of the most-requested artists on rock radio.  Capping off the Fist cycle in style, Five Finger Death Punch won the 2009 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for &quotBest New Band.&quot However, it&#39s all been simply a prelude to War.</p><p>Five Finger Death Punch has fine-tuned their songs more than ever, and their sound has progressed immensely on their latest offering. Guitarist Zoltan Bathory puts it best: &quotWe&#39ve matured but we&#39re still the same band. Maybe we&#39ve gotten closer to traditional metal on War Is the Answer.&quot</p><p>Looking to surpass their DIY debut record, 5FDP decided to enlist some big guns for War. The band produced the album alongside world renowned producer Kevin Churko (Ozzy Osbourne), and attracted legendary mixer Randy Staub (Metallica) to the project as well.  Also, the band had grown together as people, performers and songwriters.   Singer Ivan Moody relates, &quotWe tried to keep the basic ingredients but expand the sound at the same time.  We spent two and a half years on the road together, and these guys have become closer to me than my biological family.&quot</p><p>The result  on War is an expansive collection of unbridled melodic metal. Tracks like &quotBulletproof&quot illustrate Five Finger Death Punch&#39s diversity, switching from spellbinding chorus to neck-snapping solo in a flash. &#8220Burn It Down&#8221 is a nihilistic exploration in pure rage&#8212a new storyline with the same popular characters from The Way of the Fist.  Meanwhile, &#8220No One Gets Left Behind&#8221 is an up-tempo crusher that leaves room for lyrical interpretation.  &#8220You can take it literally, or as an underlying theme we often talk about,&#8221 relates Zoltan.  &#8220We are all soldiers in this human tribe.  We used to fight together against the elements of nature to survive, but today that tribal bond is completely forgotten because there are six billion of us now.  Does that devalue human life?&#8221</p><p>The band has been known for their intense guitar playing since day one, and War kicks it up several notches. Jason Hook joined the fold in 2008, lending an uncanny repertoire to the fold.</p><p>&quotJason&#39s rhythm playing is very similar to mine,&quot says Zoltan. &quotWe have our signature sound all over War Is the Answer. It&#39s a heavy machine gun style of playing. There are more solos because we wanted to utilize Jason&#39s talent. We still focused on writing great songs though because those stay around forever.&quot</p><p>The songs on War will certainly stand the test of time, and the emotions encapsulated in them are extremely tangible. Ivan confronted many of his own demons, waging war through words. The singer says, &quotIt&#39s a more personal record. On War Is the Answer, the band encouraged me to write from the heart.  There is a lot of stuff, as painful as it may be, that I tried to project on this album that I didn&#39t get a chance to on the first record.&quot</p><p>&quotWalk Away&quot is an especially poignant song. The band incorporates acoustic guitars for a haunting, heavy sound, and the track&#39s infectious, heartfelt chorus makes it a surefire single.</p><p>&quotOn &#8216Walk Away,&#8217 I wanted to wash my hands of this particular relationship in my life that has gone sour. It&#39s a cleansing. I really did put my heart and soul into this entire record&#8212no matter how hard it was. You have to expose the most ugly and raw parts of your life to really convey anything.&quot</p><p>Ivan conveys true pain in his lyrics across the entire album. He pulls no punches, especially on the powerful &quotCrossing Over.&quot His touching, episodic narrative propels the song under melancholy, melodic guitars. The entire album plays out in cinematic fashion with drama and true tension in every note. He continues, &quotWe wanted to make an album that was going to feel like a major motion picture and not just an artsy B-movie.&quot</p><p>&quotHard to See&quot could be the soundtrack to that epic. Ivan goes on, &quotThe politics of the music industry have baffled me since day one. &#39Hard to See&#39 is me lashing out at the industry. I&#39m so tired of being pulled in every direction and being told what to do. The song is about melding into the industry and learning the politics so we can be freer as artists.&quot</p><p>The band&#39s live show is more incendiary than ever. At the start, Five Finger Death Punch destroyed stages alongside Korn and Atreyu on The Family Values Tour 2007 and with Slipknot and Disturbed on the Rockstar Mayhem Festival 2008. Since then, they&#39ve had numerous successful headline jaunts in the U.S. and in Europe, with many more to come.</p><p>About their international appeal, Zoltan offers some insight. &quotIf you really dig down to the roots of the music, American bands are groove-oriented and based on rhythm and blues. European bands grow up on classical music because it&#39s very much embedded into that culture. Five Finger Death Punch has both of those roots because I&#39m from Europe, and Ivan and the rest of the guys are American. We&#39re a truly international metal band, and that fact separates us.&quot</p><p>The album&#39s title sums everything up for the band right now. Zoltan elaborates, &quotWar is the nature of man it&#39s always been, and it&#39ll never go away. War has many different manifestations so it doesn&#8217t have to be taken literally, but that urge to conquer is embedded in our genes.  We were not meant to live our lives caged in cubicles.&#8221</p><p>Ivan follows, &quotI think everyone has their own personal battles whether they&#39re religious, political or family-oriented. To us, The Way of the Fist was a swift punch to the face. War Is the Answer is the answer to that first album. You listen and you know we have to keep fighting. You can never just give up and throw it to the wayside. It shows a sign of weakness and we don&#39t plan on doing that anytime soon.&quot</p><p>In the end, this record is for the people. Ivan concludes, &quotI want fans to be as proud of War Is the Answer as we are. We&#39re not going anywhere. I want people to realize that this is from our hearts. I want the younger generation of musicians to realize if you stick to your guns and put forward the militant foot, you can get there. This band isn&#39t afraid of anything. We will go out there, sweat, bleed and experiment&#8212that&#39s everything I&#39ve looked for my entire life in a band.  Mankind is nothing but a cluster of opinions and nobody knows the real answers.  However you can move, even change people through music.  That&#8217s power and real art&quot</p><p>Indeed, Five Finger Death Punch are poised to take over the landscape.  When it comes to how, there is no question&#8212War is the Answer.</p>', 2009, NULL),
(207, 'Metallica', '<p>Since their inception in 1981, Metallica have gone from an underground heavy-metal band to one of the most successful acts in the world, with an intensely loyal if not rabid fanbase.  Their relevance is undeniable as evidenced by their ability to sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide while continuing to sell millions of albums with each release -- a feat no other band in history has sustained over a 25+ year career.</p><p>Sales of Metallica&#8217s albums (including eight full-length albums and one e.p.) total over 97 million worldwide, and have earned gold and/or platinum certifications in over forty countries.  Video/DVD sales for the band&#8217s four long-form releases are over 6 million worldwide the most for any rock band.  In addition, a live box-set release (containing over eight hours of live music and video), retailing at over $80, has sold over 750,000 units worldwide, making it the biggest selling box-set of its kind in history.   Their most recent studio album, &#8220St. Anger&#8221, with worldwide sales approaching 6 million, was #1 in 30 countries.</p><p>The band&#8217s worldwide catalog sales over the last four years are second only to those of the Beatles.  In each year from 2000 to 2006 the band&#8217s catalog sold over 2.5 million albums worldwide.  In 2004, the band&#8217s catalog topped the 4 million mark. In an industry of fickle sales - where fan loyalty is on the brink of becoming a thing of the past - and where industry sales have plummeted by an estimated 30 to 40% Metallica are the most successful modern catalog band in the world far outselling all rivals in all genres on a yearly basis.</p><p>On the broadcast front, Metallica remain the number 1 band in audience testing at all U.S. Rock radio formats (the number one for males aged 18-34) for the sixth straight year.  According to the Demers Programming, &#8220Metallica has accounted for approximately 5% of total airplay at the format over each of the past five years&#8221.  This feat is unprecedented.</p><p>Metallica have garnered numerous awards and accolades throughout the world over their career, including 6 Grammy Awards, 2 American Music Awards, 3 MTV Video Music Awards, 2 MTV Europe Video Music Awards, and over 30 California Music Awards.  In addition, their 1991 album, &quotMetallica&quot has been awarded the prestigious &quotDiamond Award&quot from the Recording Industry Association of America (given to those albums with U.S. sales of 10 million or more).  They received the ASCAP Founders Award, honoring them as songwriters (this award is unprecedented for a rock band).</p><p>When it comes to touring, there are few&#8211 if any&#8211 bands that deliver live the way Metallica does.  Their shows, which began in clubs and garages in the early eighties, are now selling out in arenas and stadiums throughout the world, and continue to be among the most intense, powerful and visually stimulating concert experiences ever delivered.  The band were the #1 concert draw in North America in the 1990&#8217s, and have remained one of the five biggest touring acts in the world over the last fifteen years.  The most impressive achievement that bears mentioning, however, is the fact that Metallica continue to be a strong attraction in the touring world a truly rare feat in today&#8217s mercurial entertainment business, where fans often change allegiance to bands as often as they do hairstyles. Their recent tour &#8211the Summer &#821707 &#8220Sick of the Studio Tour&#8221- which offered the band a brief respite from the recording of their new album, saw Metallica play twelve shows on the European continent to a total audience of nearly one million fans (including a headlining set at the London &#8220LiveEARTH&#8221 show).</p><p>Metallica are a band whose success can be directly attributed to a passion and<br/>no-compromise attitude in every project they undertake.</p>', 1983, NULL),

(216, 'The Rolling Stones', '<p>It&#39s hard to overestimate the importance of the Rolling Stones in rock &amp roll history. The group, which formed in London in 1962, distilled so much of the music that had come before it and has exerted a decisive influence on so much that has come after. Only a handful of musicians in any genre achieve that stature, and the Stones stand proudly among them.</p><p>Every album the group released through the early Seventies - from The Rolling Stones in 1964 to Exile on Main Street in 1972 -- is essential not simply to an understanding of the music of that era, but to an understanding of the era itself. In their intense interest in blues and R&ampB, the Stones connected a young American audience to music that was unknown to the vast majority of white Americans. Though the Stones were not overtly political in their early years, their obsession with African American music - from Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters and Howlin&#39 Wolf to Chuck Berry, Marvin Gaye and Don Covay - struck a chord that resonated with the goals of the civil rights movement. If the Stones had never made an album after 1965 they would still be legendary.</p><p>Soon, of course, the Stones - singer Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Brian Jones, bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, in those days - became synonymous with the rebellious attitude of that era. Songs like &quot(I Can&#39t Get No) Satisfaction,&quot &quotStreet Fighting Man,&quot &quotSympathy for the Devil&quot and &quotGimme Shelter&quot captured the violence, frustration and chaos of that era. For the Stones, the Sixties were not a time of peace and love in many ways, the band found psychedelia and wide-eyed utopianism confusing and silly. The Stones always were - and continue to be - tough pragmatists. Against the endless promises of Sixties idealism the Stones understood that &quotYou Can&#39t Always Get What You Want.&quot You simply want to Let It Be? Why not Let It Bleed?</p><p>For those reasons, as the Sixties drained into the Seventies, the Stones went on a creative run that rivals any in popular music. Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main Street (1972) routinely turn up on lists of the greatest albums of all time, and deservedly so. All done with American producer Jimmy Miller - &quotin incredible rhythm man,&quot in Richards&#39 terse description - those records shake like the culture itself was shaking. As the Stones were working on Let It Bleed, Brian Jones died, and the band replaced him with Mick Taylor, a guitarist whose lyricism and melodic flair counterbalanced Richards&#39 insistent, irreducible rhythmic drive, adding an element to the band&#39s sound that hadn&#39t been there before, and opening fertile new musical directions.</p><p>After that, the Stones were an indomitable force on the music scene, and they have continued to be to this day. In 1978, the band&#39s album, Some Girls, rose to the challenge of punk (&quotWhen the Whip Comes Down&quot) - whose energy and attitude the Stones had defined a decade earlier - but also swung with the sinuous grooves of disco (&quotMiss You&quot). The album is one of the best of that decade. Meanwhile, guitarist Ron Wood had replaced Mick Taylor in 1975, adding another key element to the version of the Rolling Stones that would last another three decades - and counting.</p><p>Tattoo You (1981) added the classics &quotStart Me Up&quot and &quotWaiting on a Friend&quot to the Stones&#39 repertoire, and took its prominent place among the Stones&#39 most compelling - and most popular - later albums. Possibly the most underrated album of the Stones&#39 career, Dirty Work finds the band at its rawest and most rhythmically charged, a reflection of the tumult within the band when it was recorded. True Stones fans have long worn their appreciation of Dirty Work as a hip badge of honor.</p><p>With the release of Steel Wheels in 1989, the Stones went back on the road again for the first time in seven years and inaugurated the latest phase of the band&#39s illustrious career. They&#39ve made strong, credible new albums during this period - Voodoo Lounge (1994), Bridges to Babylon (1997) - along with the excellent live album Stripped (1995) and the fun, satisfying hits collection, Forty Licks (2002).</p><p>More significantly, though, the Stones have set a standard for live performance during this time. That is an achievement completely in accord with the band&#39s history. When the Stones began to be introduced on their 1969 tour as &quotThe Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World,&#39 they were staking that claim on the basis of their live performances. It was almost fashionable for bands to withdraw from the road at that time - Bob Dylan and the Beatles had both done so. But the Stones set out to prove that writing brilliant songs and making powerful records did not mean that you were too lofty to get up in front of your fans and rock them until their bones rattled. The Stones&#39 live shows - epitomized, of course, by Jagger&#39s galvanizing erotic choreography - had earned the band its reputation in its earliest years, and that flame was being rekindled.</p><p>It was lit again twenty years later, and it&#39s burning still. Since 1989 the Stones have toured every few years to ecstatic response. Bassist Darryl Jones, who had formerly played with Miles Davis, joined the band in 1994, replacing Bill Wyman, and the Stones turned what could have been a setback into a rejuvenating rush of new energy. The Stones&#39 live success during this period is not a matter of dollars or box-office breakthroughs, though the band has enjoyed plenty of both. It&#39s about demonstrating a vital, ongoing commitment to the idea that performing is what keeps a band truly alive.</p><p>And that&#39s the critical misunderstanding of the question, &quotIs this the last time?&quot that has been coming up every time the Stones have toured for close to forty years now. It&#39s true that over the decades the Stones have been in the news for many reasons that have little to do with music - arrests, provocative statement, divorces, affairs, all the usual detritus of a raucous lifetime in the public eye. And there&#39s no doubt that Mick Jagger is as famous a celebrity as the world has ever seen.</p><p>But, for all that, the Stones are best understood as musicians, and their own acceptance of that fact is what has enabled them to carry on so well for so long. For all the tabloid headlines, Mick Jagger is finally an extraordinary lead singer and one of the most riveting performers - in any genre - ever to set foot on a stage. Keith Richards is the propulsive engine that drives the Stones and makes their music instantly recognizable. Ron Wood is a guitarist who has formed a rhythmic brotherhood with Richards, but who also colors and textures the band&#39s songs with deft, melodic touches. And Charlie Watts, needless to say, is one of rock&#39s greatest drummers. He is both the rock that anchors the band, and the force that swings it. At once elegant in their simplicity and soaring in their impact, none of his gestures are wasted, all are necessary. He and Darryl Jones enliven the often-monolithic notion of the rock &amp roll rhythm section with an irresistible, unpretentious, jazz-derived sophistication.</p><p>Musicians live and create in the moment, and that&#39s why fans still go see the Stones. Certainly there&#39s also a catalogue of songs that only a handful of artists could rival. Surely there&#39s also the desire to encounter a band that has played a pristine role in defining our very idea of what rock &amp roll is. But seeing the Rolling Stones live is to see a working band playing as hard as they can, and there&#39s no last time for that.</p><p>-Anthony DeCurtis</p>', 1968, NULL),

(221, 'Pink Floyd', '<p>In the early 1960s, a bunch of boys from Cambridge began jamming together, and out of those encounters were born the early incarnations of Pink Floyd. More than 40 years and 150 million album sales later, the band headlined the biggest global music event in history &#8211 Live 8 &#8211 and was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. You could say the Floyd has staying power.</p><p>The main characters in their story - all the children of teachers or academics &#8211 are Roger &#8216Syd&#8217 Barrett, Roger Waters and David Gilmour. (Waters was ahead of Barrett at school Gilmour and Barrett were in the same year at college.) While Gilmour went pro at 18, the other two pursued higher education in London, vowing to start a band there.</p><p>When Barrett arrived at Camberwell art school in 1964, Waters was already studying architecture at Regent Street Poly, where he had met the talented pianist Rick Wright, the drummer Nick Mason and various other musically inclined friends. Barrett joined the group, which played r &#8216n&#8217 b standards at student dances under such names as Sigma 6 and the Megadeaths (as well as the architecturally inspired T-Set, the dopier Tea Set, and the Architectural Abdabs). And after a few months, they settled into a four-piece, with Barrett on lead guitar and vocals, and Waters on bass.</p><p>&#8216Syd&#8217 was stylish, charismatic and creative. A natural front man for the band, he was always interested in screwing new effects from equipment, particularly echo machines, and under his leadership, their sound soon became freakier &#8211 or as Wright, on keyboards, put it, &#8216more improvised, [with] more room for my classical feel&#8217. When Barrett began to produce his own songs &#8211 poetic whimsies that chimed well with the growing hippie movement &#8211 a new identity seemed appropriate. His solution was to combine the names of two venerable bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. (The old joke went that the band could have ended up as Anderson Council &#8211 until a tribute band took the name.)</p><p>Serendipity and synchronicity now played their part. Thanks to the budding drugs barons of his hometown&#8217s many laboratories, Barrett and his circle had been familiar with the &#8216mind-expanding&#8217 properties of LSD from their mid-teens. By 1965, he wanted to stage musical events that opened the same doors of perception - and his new landlord provided the answer.</p><p>Barrett and Waters were renting rooms from Mike Leonard, an avant-garde lecturer at the Hornsey College of Art. He introduced them to his books, his sound-effects library &#8211 and most importantly, the concept of &#8216light shows&#8217. The Floyd became the house-musicians for Leonard&#8217s workshops and when they landed gigs at a couple of the Goings-On club&#8217s newly hip &#8216happenings&#8217 in Soho, they took the idea with them. While the boys stretched tracks to 40 minutes or more, their lights crew boiled inks over coloured slides and bathed the band in the mirrored projections of an upended machine.</p><p>The kids went wild, and by the end of 1966, Pink Floyd were darlings of the counter culture. Playing Syd&#8217s compositions, they were regulars at the Marquee and held their own happenings in Notting Hill. They were on the bill for benefits at the Roundhouse and the Albert Hall, and the main attraction at the UFO club&#8217s &#8216night trippers&#8217.</p><p>In February 1967, for the not inconsiderable sum of &#1635000, they were signed by EMI - &#8216We want to be pop stars,&#8217 said Barrett &#8211 and added punishing recording deadlines to their already-exhausting touring commitments. By August, they were one of the brightest bands in the country &#8211 but from the first, they declined to be pigeonholed. As well as criss-crossing Britain to play in clubs and dance halls, they performed a pretentious piece at the Royal Festival Hall. And despite a deal that stipulated they concentrate on LPs &#8211 something previously unheard of &#8211 they had already notched up two top 20 singles, &#8216Arnold Layne&#8217 and &#8216See Emily Play&#8217, before delivering a top ten album.</p><p>&#8216Piper At The Gates Of Dawn&#8217, was recorded at Abbey Road while the Beatles finished &#8216Sgt. Pepper&#8217 in the next studio. Written almost entirely by Barrett, the first Floyd album had a crystalline sound, unlike the juddering space-jams of their live shows - and unlike any they would make again. Though the emphasis was on such Tolkein-and-spliff ditties as &#8216The Gnome&#8217, &#8216Scarecrow&#8217 and &#8216Bike&#8217, &#8216Interstellar Overdrive&#8217 and &#8216Astronomy Domine&#8217 were astonishing pieces. Pink Floyd had arrived. However, behind the scenes - in a pattern that would repeat itself 15 years later - the band was staggering towards a crisis. Barrett hated the rigours of the industry and from his increasing waywardness in concert and studio, it appeared the &#8216golden goose&#8217, as Waters called him, was losing his mind.</p><p>At first, nobody could be sure. Acting inscrutably was a cool pose for an underground icon, so Syd&#8217s refusal to speak on the Pat Boone Show, during the Floyd&#8217s first US outing, sat comfortably enough with his reputation. But the frequency with which he detuned his guitar on stage, and his vehement weirdness in the studio, convinced the rest of the band that the situation was untenable. As a stopgap, David Gilmour was recruited to cover for Barrett on stage. A plan was mooted whereby Barrett would stay home and write for the other four, as the broken-down Brian Wilson did for the Beach Boys. But in the end, he went his way and they went theirs.</p><p>What road would the new Floyd travel, though? Gilmour, who thought their gigs were &#8216too anarchic&#8217, was confident he could &#8216knock them into shape&#8217 musically. But now they would have to generate their own material. While Waters developed his lyrical powers, Gilmour and Wright experimented with new soundscapes, slipping between rock and jazz, folk and classical, electronic and pop. This approach would make the Floyd huge in Europe, where their &#8216intellectualism&#8217 was admired, long before they became superstars in the rest of the world. In the meantime, it sustained them through the Sixties.</p><p>The second Floyd album, &#8216A Saucerful of Secrets&#8217 (released in June 1968), was started before Barrett&#8217s departure and is an understandably fraught portrait of a group in transition. Despite reaching number nine in the charts, it revealed a curious hybrid of the group they had been and the one they were to become, and is most noticeable for a song on which Waters wrote the lyrics and, surprisingly, the hypnotic riff. Although the band hated the term &#8216space rock&#8217, &#8216Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&#8217 clearly sign-posted the direction they would follow.</p><p>Not that they took the most direct route. Over the next two years, while writing new material to be refined in performance &#8211 and providing the BBC with live atmospherics for the first moon landing - the Floyd worked on three main recording projects. They contributed to the score of Antonioni&#8217s movie &#8216Zabriskie Point&#8217. (The high point is a house exploding in slow motion to a reworking of the instrumental &#8216Careful With That Axe, Eugene&#8217 see below.) They wrote the soundtrack for Barbet Schroeder&#8217s far-out film &#8216More&#8217, releasing an eponymous album in 1969. And in the same year, they put out a double-album &#8211 of half live, half solo recordings &#8211 called &#8216Ummagumma&#8217, a Cambridge euphemism for sex.</p><p>Although the latter showed the Floyd still toying with various musical modes, it also contained the definitive version of the eerie &#8216Eugene&#8217 and that track probably helped the album to number five in the charts - their highest position yet &#8211 well, that and the sleeve&#8217s artwork. The band had employed Storm Thorgersen, a Cambridge pal at the groovy design agency Hipgnosis, to knock up a sleeve for &#8216Saucer&#8217. Now, with an &#8216infinite&#8217 multiple group portrait, he came up with the first of many striking images. Thereafter, the Floyd paid as much attention to the look of their product as to the effects on stage, increasingly deflecting attention away from individual members and towards big &#8216concepts&#8217.</p><p>Step forward, a cow, gracing the Floyd&#8217s first album of the new decade. Released in October 1970, the bizarre &#8216Atom Heart Mother&#8217 was another double. Yet despite one of the four sides being a 23-minute title track, using full orchestra and choir - and despite &#8216Alan&#8217s Psychedelic Breakfast&#8217, a noisy mosaic of popping gas fires, whistling kettles and sundry &#8216found&#8217 sounds - this was the band&#8217s first LP to reach number one. Within a year, they had consolidated that success by producing, in &#8216Meddle&#8217, their first truly accessible album of the post-Syd era.</p><p>Gilmour now established himself as a world-class guitarist through his searing work on &#8216One of These Days&#8217 and the full-side &#8216Echoes&#8217 (a sublime piece that grew out of one piano note, fed by Wright through his Leslie rotating speaker unit). Indeed, with his musicality, flowing locks and mellifluous lead vocals, he might have been mistaken for the band&#8217s leader. In fact he, Wright and Mason relied on Waters, the Floyd&#8217s co-founder with Syd, to provide the drive, the vision - and the lyrics. When they played to their strengths, this division of labour led to some of the most memorable music of the 20th century and for the next few years, the arrangement held.</p><p>During this period, the Floyd continued to cross cultural borders. Touring &#8216Meddle&#8217, they took in a classical festival in Montreux. They performed for film cameras in the ruins of Pompei, and played with the Roland Petit Ballet in Marseilles. (&#8216I think we always saw the music in three-dimensional form. The albums were just building blocks&#8230to a greater edifice, which was the live performance,&#8217 explained Waters.) But most importantly, they began work on an idea that turned into Pink Floyd&#8217s most popular record &#8211 and with 40 million copies sold, the third biggest album of all time &#8211 &#8216The Dark Side of the Moon&#8217.</p><p>The new work was provisionally titled &#8216Eclipse&#8217, and performed in concerts around Europe throughout 1972. (&#8216It was initially about the pressures of real life - travel, money, madness - and then it broadened out a bit,&#8217 recalls Mason.) Recorded at Abbey Road towards the end of the year, and released in the spring of 1973, it raised the bar for &#8216concept&#8217 albums to heights never since reached. America, which had paid the Floyd little serious attention before, now bought into them in a big way. The track &#8216Money&#8217 was a hit single, while its parent album took up residence in the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 15 years. With larger audiences, the stage shows expanded to fill stadiums. There were better films, brighter lights and vast flying theatrical props (led by a &#8216crashing&#8217 aeroplane). More than ever, the imagery supplied a surreal commentary on the music, and reinforced the band&#8217s invisibility.</p><p>The Floyd weren&#39t a group now, so much as an experience. They had grown from big cult into one of the cornerstones of rock. Yet, as Gilmour sees it, &#8216Dark Side&#8217 had its dark side: &#8216The music, the lyrics and the visual design all came together, and&#8230 we were hoist by the petard of its success. You [thrive on] objectives, goals, desires - and with &#8220Dark Side&#8221, they were suddenly all achieved.&#8217 Although the band&#8217s four members worked together for another ten years, it was with growing disunity. True, the creative peak of &#8216Wish You Were Here&#8217 had not yet been reached &#8211 nor the extraordinary phenomenon of &#8216The Wall&#8217 &#8211 but the first cracks were beginning to show. Waters began to hog the ball, and Gilmour to take his eye off it.</p><p>Touring and recuperation over, the next two Floyd albums had their origins in a protracted rehearsal session in 1974, when three long pieces were sketched out. Two of these eventually appeared as &#8216Sheep&#8217 and &#8216Dogs&#8217 on the 1976 &#8216Animals&#8217 album the other, &#8216Shine On, You Crazy Diamond&#8217, as the basis of their next release, &#8216Wish You Were Here&#8217. Waters&#8217 lyrics increasingly dwelt on communication breakdown, and &#8216Shine On&#8217 was both a message to, and an elegy for Syd Barrett. So the subject&#8217s arrival during its recording has become one of the most curious incidents in Floyd history.</p><p>In 1969 and 1970 - with the help of Waters, Wright and particularly Gilmour - Barrett had made two solo albums which, though patchy, were touched with genius. However, the records met with little commercial success and, with his mental health deteriorating, he retired to Cambridge. (&#8216I&#8217m full of dust and guitars,&#8217 he said.) None of the band had seen Barrett for five years when, as Wright remembers, &#8216It was the weirdest coincidence. I walked into the studio at Abbey Road, Roger was at the desk working on &#8220Shine On&#8221, and I saw this guy sitting on the couch behind. Big, about 16 stone, bald. I didn&#39t think anything of it, because strangers were always turning up in the studio in those days. And then it suddenly clicked. Syd.&#8217</p><p>Barrett slipped off, back into obscurity. Waters clung on to his ambiguous affair with the limelight. The Floyd&#8217s concerts had, he felt, lost their old power to communicate. Their increasingly theatrical ambitions - manifest in the 40-foot inflatable pig designed to launch &#8216Animals&#8217 - didn&#39t seem to be engaging the audience&#39s attention in the right way. Moreover, a new generation of Floyd fans wanted the old hits, particularly those from &#8216Dark Side&#8217. At the end of the 1977 &#8216Animals&#8217 tour, hearing them scream for &#8216Money&#8217 in Montreal&#39s Olympic stadium, Waters lost his temper and spat into the audience. Later, he channelled his frustration into a project exploring the gulf between the star and his audience. And thus began the Floyd&#8217s most grandiose project to date: &#8216The Wall&#8217.</p><p>Despite Gilmour&#8217s difficulties with the idea &#8211 and with Water&#8217s increasingly bleak aesthetic &#8211 he did contribute some flashes of brilliance to the music, notably in &#8216Comfortably Numb&#8217. But this double album was really Waters&#8217 baby. And Waters was beginning to feel that Pink Floyd was a one-man band: his. Just before the end of recording in 1979, Waters decided unilaterally that the increasingly disengaged Wright was dead wood, and presented him with an ultimatum: either he voluntarily left the band after &#8216The Wall&#8217 tour, or the tapes would never be delivered&#8230</p><p>When the Floyd went on the road with &#8216The Wall&#8217 for a limited run of concerts in 1980, the epic scale of rock&#8217s most ambitiously theatrical concert masked a group suffering from a textbook case of &#8216musical differences&#8217. The giant wall of cardboard bricks at the front was only one of several hefty symbolic barriers up there on stage. Yet, despite the difficult gestation, the album sold 20 million copies worldwide and spawned the Floyd&#39s only number one hit single, the anti-authoritarian school-kids&#8217 anthem, &#8216Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2&#8217. The stage show, designed by Waters and the satirical cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, was subsequently made into a film by the director Alan Parker, with Bob Geldof starring as Pink, a celebrity-maddened rock dictator.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, Geldof was to play an equally dramatic role in the Pink Floyd story. But back in the early Eighties, the group &#8211 sans Wright - had virtually devolved into a non-co-operative association of solo artists. The decision to record a selection of Waters&#39 material that hadn&#39t made in onto &#8216The Wall&#8217, and to release that as &#8216The Final Cut&#8217, was probably one of the band&#39s less inspired, and least unanimous, decisions. (&#8216It was really Roger&#39s solo album,&#8217 says Mason. &#8216The rest of us just sort of drifted into it.&#8217) Water&#8217s theme - the death of his father, just after his own birth, on the wartime beaches of Anzio &#8211 may not have sounded like a winner. Still, &#8216The Final Cut&#8217 became another number one in 1983.</p><p>Two years later, Waters announced that he was leaving. When Gilmour and Mason decided, in 1986, that they would continue Pink Floyd without him and take their show on the road, Waters contacted his lawyers, claiming that the name, which he had disowned, no longer had any validity. &#8216There was a lot of legal posturing,&#8217 says Gilmour, &#8216but it never went to court.&#8217 After initially threatening to put an injunction on any promoter who staged a Pink Floyd concert, Waters backed off &#8211 and the 210,000 tickets sold in Toronto within three hours, later proved the world still firmly believed in the Pink Floyd experience.</p><p>Though it attracted far less publicity than the threat of litigation, in December 1987 an agreement was reached between Waters, Gilmour and Mason, which forever settled any dispute over rights to the name. But long before that, said Gilmour, he and Mason &#8216just wanted to move forward&#8217. Their first act was to re-establish contact with Rick Wright, then retired to Greece, where he had married and invested in a yacht. (&#8216The door was opened again,&#8217 he said, &#8216and I walked through it.&#8217) Their next was to record the album &#8216A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&#8217 (1987) which was chiefly overseen by Gilmour - by his own admission, the only one &#8216obstinate and pig-headed enough&#8217 not to have been demoralised by the years of conflict with Waters.</p><p>The subsequent Floyd world tour grew into their longest and most successful outing ever: over four years, five and a half million people saw 200 shows - including a Venetian gig on a floating stage, in the summer of 1989, and another at the Palace of Versailles. &#8216A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&#8217, and its live offshoot, &#8216Delicate Sound Of Thunder&#8217, sold more than 11 million copies worldwide, bringing total sales of Floyd albums to 140 million. The live set also attained the distinction of being the first rock music played in outer space (in November 1988, by the crew of the Soviet-French Soyuz-7 mission). But Gilmour felt they could do better &#8211 and in 1994, proved it with &#8216The Division Bell&#8217.</p><p>Said the Floyd&#8217s undisputed new leader: &#8216We went out last time with the intention of showing the world, &#8220Look, we&#39re still here!&#8221 And consequently, the &#8220Momentary Lapse of Reason&#8221 album was very loud and crash-bang-y. The new album is much more reflective - and as such, I personally like it more than anything we&#39ve done since &#8220Wish You Were Here&#8221.&#8217 This album, it&#8217s fair to say, represented a return to form that went missing from the Floyd sometime in the Seventies. The accompanying world tour featured a show even more spectacular than their last &#8211 and was made all the more memorable by the decision, taken towards the end of the US leg, to devote the second half to &#8216Dark Side&#8217. (This was the first time the Floyd had performed it from start to finish in over 20 years.) The tour concluded in London with an astonishing run of 14 nights at the 17,000-capacity Earl&#8217s Court arena, still an attendance record.</p><p>Since &#8216The Division Bell&#8217, there have been two Floyd releases. &#8216P.U.L.S.E.&#8217 was a double CD, or triple vinyl, live album, of which there was later a video. (Recorded on their last tour, it thus bears the first-ever official concert recording of &#8216Dark Side&#8217 in its entirety). And &#8216Echoes&#8217 was a double CD &#8216best of&#8217 box set, including many of the songs name-checked here. Yet the band has not been inactive. In June 2005, Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof pulled off a diplomatic coup by persuading Waters and Gilmour to bury the hatchet for the sake of his campaign against world poverty. As night fell on Hyde Park, millions of fans around the world, who had never before had the chance, saw the four-piece Floyd playing their own songs, as they had conceived them. Millions more became new fans - this was their first exposure - and as so often in the last four decades, a wave of interest surged around them.</p>', 1973, NULL),
(222, 'The Beach Boys', '<p>Their classic songs epitomize the spirit of the California lifestyle and The Beach Boys have become an American icon to a worldwide audience. The Beach Boys&#8217 first hit &#8220Surfin&#8217&#8221 (1961) launched a string of chart-topping songs that spans nearly forty years and includes eternal anthems of American youth: &#8220Surfin&#8217 USA&#8221, &#8220Surfer Girl&#8221, &#8220Fun, Fun, Fun&#8221, &#8220I Get Around&#8221, &#8220California Girls&#8221, &#8220Help Me Rhonda&#8221, &#8220Barbara Ann&#8221, &#8220Good Vibrations&#8221, &#8221Wouldn&#8217t It Be Nice&#8221, &#8220Rock and Roll Music&#8221, &#8220Kokomo&#8221 and more.</p><p>Their chart success alone would have earned The Beach Boys their spot in The Rock n&#8217 Roll Hall of Fame (they were inducted in 1988), not to mention 32 RIAA Platinum and Gold record awards and worldwide sales estimated at over 100 million. But The Beach Boys&#39 story is one of not only commercial but also artistic success. Their unique blend of harmonies, musical arrangements and timeless lyrics still place the music of The Beach Boys among the All-Time Favorites of today&#8217s music critics. As an example, VH-1 named &#8220Pet Sounds&#8221 as the #3 album in the Top 100 Albums in Rock &#39n&#39 Roll History, as judged in a poll of musicians, executives and journalists. The Beach Boys were honored at the 2001 Grammy Awards, receiving The Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy.</p><p>In the 1960&#39s, there were two groups on Capitol Records - one American, the other British - whose name began with the letters &quotB-E-A-.&quot Each of these groups featured a bass playing songwriter born in June of 1942, and each group made records that have withstood the test of time to become classics of popular culture.</p><p>The Beatles, of course, broke up in 1970. But the American band, The Beach Boys, continued on, recording new material and selling out concert tours. To this day, generations of fans are still falling in love with the golden harmonies of California&#39s musical ambassadors to the world.</p><p>For The Beach Boys, it all began in the modest home of Murry and Audree Wilson in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne. In the bedroom shared by their sons, oldest brother Brian taught his younger siblings to sing. In late-night sessions, middle brother Dennis and baby brother Carl learned the harmonies that Brian had absorbed from countless listenings to Four Freshmen and Hi-Los records.</p><p>Joining in on Christmas carols at holiday gatherings was Mike Love, the Wilson brothers&#39 first cousin. Mike and Brian also spent many nights together in the late &#3950&#39s listening to the car radio and singing along to their favorite hits of the day.</p><p>However, until 1961, singing was just something the Wilson/Love clan did for fun. It was when that familial foursome became five in 1961, with the addition of Al Jardine (Brian&#39s Hawthorne High football teammate and El Camino Junior College classmate) that the self-named &quotPendletones&quot began to take their vocalizing a little more seriously. Al had a love of folk music and his voice was the fourth part to fill out the harmony blend.</p><p>When Murry and Audree returned from a trip to Mexico, they found that Brian and Mike had penned &#8220Surfin&#8217,&#8221 which would become The Beach Boys first single release on the Candix label. Thanks to a remarkable chain of events, they made their first recording and miraculously scored their first chart record.</p><p>The formula? Their California garage band sound and an original song about a local fad had immediate teen appeal, and &quotSurfin&#39&quot reached the Top 3 on L.A. radio hit-lists. But as each of the newly-named Beach Boys earned only about $200 from that moment of fame, in early &#3962 (even though the group had made their live performing debut on December 31, 1961 at a Ritchie Valens memorial concert), the record business probably felt more like a hobby than a job. After all, Carl and Dennis were still in high school, Al and Brian were in college and Mike was 20 and working a full-time job.</p><p>Nonetheless, they were determined to have a career, and they cut a demo tape that would turn out to be their first major label record. With that tape and the help of the Wilson brothers&#39 father, Murry, the group secured a record contract with Capitol Records in mid-1962. Their first single, &quotSurfin&#39 Safari&quot b/w &quot409&quot was virtually an overnight hit, and almost right out of the box, The Beach Boys became Capitol&#39s hottest act.</p><p>In the late summer of &#3962, the group recorded their first long-player, Surfin&#39 Safari, and that release triggered an avalanche of music. From 1962-1969, Capitol released 20 Beach Boys albums, many of which went &quotGold&quot and hit the Top 20, as The Beach Boys became first the most popular group in American and ultimately one of the most popular in the world.</p><p>In another milestone, The Beach Boys pioneered the concept of the self-contained band, and in the process, revolutionized the recording business. In an unparalleled act of rock &#39n&#39 roll rebellion, The Beach Boys, with Murry Wilson running interference, turned the system upside down, demanding and winning the right to control their records. The Beach Boys&#39 declaration of independence smashed all precedents. Brian Wilson won his creative freedom, and The Beach Boys became the first, and for a long time, the only rock artists to completely control the musical output of their career.</p><p>From the beginning, the group featured Carl Wilson (Brian&#39s studio sidekick, the musical director of the touring band and a truly pacific soul) on lead guitar Dennis (the inspiration for The Beach Boys&#39 first song, the group&#39s sex symbol and a real surfing beach boy) bashed on drums Mike Love (Brian&#39s first lyrical collaborator and the co-writer of many of The Beach Boys&#39 biggest hits) sang lead and became the extroverted emcee of the live shows Al Jardine (briefly replaced by Wilson neighbor David Marks in 1962 and 1963) strummed rhythm guitar and added his voice to the family blend and Brian played bass, wrote the songs, arranged the instruments and the vocals, and produced the records. When Brian quit touring in late 1964, to spend more time in the studio, his spot was filled temporarily by then-studio musician Glen Campbell and permanently by songwriter/record producer Bruce Johnston.</p><p>The Beach Boys&#39 biggest hits read like a soundtrack of the 1960s, from their early surf and car songs like &quotSurfin&#39 USA&quot and &quotLittle Deuce Coupe&quot to the fun in the sun smashes like &quotFun, Fun, Fun&quot and &quotCalifornia Girls&quot...from the psychedelic beauty of &quotGood Vibrations&quot to the nostalgic &quotDo It Again.&quot From 1962-1965, The Beach Boys scored 16 Top 40 hits including &quotI Get Around&quot b/w &quotDon&#39t Worry Baby,&quot one of the greatest singles of all time, and a #1 smash for the group at the very height of Beatlemania.</p><p>In 1966, The Beach Boys&#39 one-two punch of the Pet Sounds album and the &quotGood Vibrations&quot single, earned the group international acclaim, and established group leader Brian Wilson as the influential genius of modern pop music. As Paul McCartney recently remarked, &quotPet Sounds was my inspiration for making Sgt. Pepper&#39s...the big influence. That was the big thing for me (in 1966). I just thought, &#39Oh, dear me. This is the album of all-time. What are we going to do?&#39&quot At the end of 1966, a year-end poll in one of England&#39s music papers found The Beach Boys topping The Beatles as the #1 vocal group in the world.</p><p>In 1967-1969, the last years of their first Capitol association, The Beach Boys had five more Top 40 hits and released a number of albums, such as Brian&#39s personal favorite, Friends, which The Beach Boys fans and critics regard fondly and 20/20 with the Top 20 hit &#8220Do It Again&#8221. In 1969, The Beach Boys recorded their final Capitol single, appropriately titled &quotBreakaway&quot to indicate that it was the end of the relationship.</p><p>The next era for The Beach Boys, which coincidentally began as The Beatles called it quits, is affectionately known as the &#8220Brother Years&#8221, in reference to Brother Records, the new family-owned record label and home to The Beach Boys. The new arrangement brought the boys a new level of freedom and control of their music. The broader dimension of the Brother releases showcased the songwriting and production of Dennis, Carl, Al and Bruce in addition to a number of songs penned by Brian and Mike. In the Nineties, the two eras were united when Capitol Records became the licensee of the Brother Records catalog.</p><p>The first two Brother releases, 1970&#8217s Sunflower and 1971&#8217s Surf&#8217s Up, are now recognized, by critics and fans, as two overlooked masterpieces. As a group, The Beach Boys were at their prime but rock guitars and feedback eclipsed the brilliant pop music. With 1972&#8217s Carl and the Passions &#8211 So Tough and 1973&#8217s Holland, The Beach Boys wrestled with different music styles. Even with their new sonic adventures, their harmonies, the taproot of The Beach Boys sounds, always shined through.</p><p>Around this time, with much thanks to Carl and Mike, The Beach Boys transformed themselves into one of the world&#8217s premiere live acts, a title their former labelmates, The Beatles, never could claim. With Carl&#8217s musical direction and Mike&#8217s role as lead singer and frontman, The Beach Boys took all the hits and the studio gems and converted them into arena-rock anthems. Seeing The Beach Boys summer concert tour became a truly American experience. A new generation of fans made the music of The Beach Boys their soundtrack to summer. The Beach Boys in Concert, an album that came out in 1973, offers an excellent aural snapshot of this burgeoning entity. On the heels of their touring success, Capitol Records released a 2-record &#8220best of&#8221 collection, Endless Summer, in 1974. It went straight to Number 1 on the album chart and remained on the chart for 3 years. Rolling Stone Magazine went on to name The Beach Boys the band of the year in 1974.</p><p>The band took the momentum back into the studio and recorded 15 Big Ones, their first studio record in 3 years. Brian Wilson was back on board and contributed 5 tracks. The band had a chance to pay tribute to their favorite 50s tunes while reinterpreting their signature sound. 15 Big Ones went Top 10 on the album chart. It was followed in 1977 with The Beach Boys Love You.</p><p>The late 70&#8217s brought the releases M.I.U. (1978), L.A. Album (1979), and Keepin&#8217 The Summer Alive (1980). Brothers Carl and Dennis each released their own solo albums. Dennis released his solo album, Pacific Ocean Blue in 1977. Carl released his solo album, Carl Wilson in 1981 and a second record, Youngblood followed in 1984. In 1985 the band released the self-titled album The Beach Boys that featured the Top 20 hit &#8220Getcha Back&#8221. Dennis remained a member of The Beach Boys until his drowning death in 1983. Carl Wilson passed away in 1998.</p><p>In 1988, The Beach Boys were at the top of the pop charts with the #1 single &#8220Kokomo&#8221 from the Cocktail Motion Picture Soundtrack. The multi-platinum &#8220Kokomo&#8221 is The Beach Boys biggest selling hit, climbing to #1 on the pop music and video charts of Billboard, Cashbox, Radio &amp Records and Hits magazines in 1988.</p><p>The 1980&#8217s and 90&#8217s found The Beach Boys performing at milestone events including: the Live Aid Concert, Farm Aid concerts, the Statue of Liberty&#8217s 100th Anniversary Salute and the Super Bowl. In 1980, they played to over 500,000 people in the first of four Independence Day concerts on the Washington Monument Grounds. On July 4, 1985 they played to an afternoon crowd of an estimated one million in Philadelphia and that evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington, D.C. Former U.S. Secretary of Interior James Watt&#8217s efforts to ban The Beach Boys from the Washington Monument Grounds in 1983 created an international furor that VH-1 has termed one of the most important moments in rock.<br/>Brian also returned to the studio in 1988 and released his first solo album Brian Wilson that was met with critical acclaim. In 1998 released Imagination also to rave reviews and launched his firstsolo tour and has been actively touring ever since.</p>', 1999, NULL),

(225, 'Jimi Hendrix', '<p>Widely recognized as one of the most creative and influential musicians of the 20th century, Jimi Hendrix pioneered the explosive possibilities of the electric guitar. Hendrix&#39s innovative style of combining fuzz, feedback and controlled distortion created a new musical form. Because he was unable to read or write music, it is nothing short of remarkable that Jimi Hendrix&#39s meteoric rise in the music took place in just four short years. His musical language continues to influence a host of modern musicians, from George Clinton to Miles Davis, and Steve Vai to Jonny Lang.</p><p>Jimi Hendrix, born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942, at Seattle&#39s King County Hospital, was later renamed James Marshall by his father, James &quotAl&quot Hendrix. Young Jimmy (as he was referred to at the time) took an interest in music, drawing influence from virtually every major artist at the time, including B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin&#39 Wolf, Buddy Holly, and Robert Johnson. Entirely self-taught, Jimmy&#39s inability to read music made him concentrate even harder on the music he heard.<br/>Al took notice of Jimmy&#39s interest in the guitar, recalling, &quotI used to have Jimmy clean up the bedroom all the time while I was gone, and when I would come home I would find a lot of broom straws around the foot of the bed. I&#39d say to him, `Well didn&#39t you sweep up the floor?&#39 and he&#39d say, `Oh yeah,&#39 he did. But I&#39d find out later that he used to be sitting at the end of the bed there and strumming the broom like he was playing a guitar.&quot Al found an old one-string ukulele, which he gave to Jimmy to play a huge improvement over the broom.</p><p>By the summer of 1958, Al had purchased Jimmy a five-dollar, second-hand acoustic guitar from one of his friends. Shortly thereafter, Jimmy joined his first band, The Velvetones. After a three-month stint with the group, Jimmy left to pursue his own interests. The following summer, Al purchased Jimmy his first electric guitar, a Supro Ozark 1560S Jimmy used it when he joined The Rocking Kings.</p><p>In 1961, Jimmy left home to enlist in the United States Army and in November 1962 earned the right to wear the &quotScreaming Eagles&quot patch for the paratroop division. While stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Jimmy formed The King Casuals with bassist Billy Cox. After being discharged due to an injury he received during a parachute jump, Jimmy began working as a session guitarist under the name Jimmy James. By the end of 1965, Jimmy had played with several marquee acts, including Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, the Isley Brothers, and Little Richard. Jimmy parted ways with Little Richard to form his own band, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, shedding the role of back-line guitarist for the spotlight of lead guitar.</p><p>Throughout the latter half of 1965, and into the first part of 1966, Jimmy played the rounds of smaller venues throughout Greenwich Village, catching up with Animals&#39 bassist Chas Chandler during a July performance at Cafe Wha? Chandler was impressed with Jimmy&#39s performance and returned again in September 1966 to sign Hendrix to an agreement that would have him move to London to form a new band.</p><p>Switching gears from bass player to manager, Chandler&#39s first task was to change Hendrix&#39s name to &quotJimi.&quot Featuring drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, the newly formed Jimi Hendrix Experience quickly became the talk of London in the fall of 1966.</p><p>The Experience&#39s first single, &quotHey Joe,&quot spent ten weeks on the UK charts, topping out at spot No. 6 in early 1967. The debut single was quickly followed by the release of a full-length album Are You Experienced, a psychedelic musical compilation featuring anthems of a generation. Are You Experienced has remained one of the most popular rock albums of all time, featuring tracks like &quotPurple Haze,&quot &quotThe Wind Cries Mary,&quot &quotFoxey Lady,&quot &quotFire,&quot and &quotAre You Experienced?&quot</p><p>Although Hendrix experienced overwhelming success in Britain, it wasn&#39t until he returned to America in June 1967 that he ignited the crowd at the Monterey International Pop Festival with his incendiary performance of &quotWild Thing.&quot Literally overnight, The Jimi Hendrix Experience became one of most popular and highest grossing touring acts in the world.</p><p>Hendrix followed Are You Experienced with Axis: Bold As Love. By 1968, Hendrix had taken greater control over the direction of his music he spent considerable time working the consoles in the studio, with each turn of a knob or flick of the switch bringing clarity to his vision.</p><p>Back in America, Jimi Hendrix built his own recording studio, Electric Lady Studios in New York City. The name of this project became the basis for his most demanding musical release, a two LP collection, Electric Ladyland. Throughout 1968, the demands of touring and studio work took its toll on the group and in 1969 the Experience disbanded.</p><p>The summer of 1969 brought emotional and musical growth to Jimi Hendrix. In playing the Woodstock Music &amp Art Fair in August 1969, Jimi joined forces with an eclectic ensemble called Gypsy Sun &amp Rainbows featuring Jimi Hendrix, Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, Juma Sultan, and Jerry Velez. The Woodstock performance was highlighted by the renegade version of &quotStar Spangled Banner,&quot which brought the mud-soaked audience to a frenzy.</p><p>Nineteen sixty-nine also brought about a new and defining collaboration featuring Jimi Hendrix on guitar, bassist Billy Cox and Electric Flag drummer Buddy Miles. Performing as the Band of Gypsys, this trio launched a series of four New Year&#39s performances on December 31, 1969 and January 1, 1970. Highlights from these performances were compiled and later released on the quintessential Band of Gypsys album in early-1970 and the expanded Hendrix: Live At The Fillmore East in 1999.</p><p>As 1970 progressed, Jimi brought back drummer Mitch Mitchell to the group and together with Billy Cox on bass, this new trio once again formed The Jimi Hendrix Experience. In the studio, the group recorded several tracks for another two LP set, tentatively titled First Rays Of The New Rising Sun. Unfortunately, Hendrix was unable to see this musical vision through to completion due to his hectic worldwide touring schedules, then tragic death on September 18, 1970. Fortunately, the recordings Hendrix slated for release on the album were finally issued through the support of his family and original studio engineer Eddie Kramer on the 1997 release First Rays Of The New Rising Sun.</p><p>From demo recordings to finished masters, Jimi Hendrix generated an amazing collection of songs over the course of his short career. The music of Jimi Hendrix embraced the influences of blues, ballads, rock, R&ampB, and jazz a collection of styles that continue to make Hendrix one of the most popular figures in the history of rock music.</p>', 1970, NULL);

(226, 'The Doors', '<p>With an intoxicating, genre-blending sound, provocative and uncompromising songs, and the mesmerizing power of singer Jim Morrison&#39s poetry and presence, the Doors had a transformative impact not only on popular music but on popular culture.</p><p>The Doors&#39 arrival on the rock scene in 1967 marked not only the start of a string of hit singles and albums that would become stone classics, but also of something much bigger - a new and deeper relationship between creators and audience.  Refusing to be mere entertainers, the Los Angeles quartet relentlessly challenged, confronted and inspired their fans, leaping headfirst into the heart of darkness while other bands warbled about peace and love.  Though they&#39ve had scores of imitators, there&#39s never been another band quite like them.  And 40 years after their debut album, the Doors&#39 music and legacy are more influential than ever before.</p><p>Morrison&#39s mystical command of the frontman role may be the iconic heart of the Doors, but the group&#39s extraordinary power would hardly have been possible without the virtuosic keyboard tapestries of Ray Manzarek, the gritty, expressive fretwork of guitarist Robby Krieger and the supple, dynamically rich grooves of drummer John Densmore. From baroque art-rock to jazz-infused pop to gutbucket blues, the band&#39s instrumental triad could navigate any musical territory with aplomb - and all three contributed mightily as songwriters.</p><p>The group was born when Morrison and Manzarek - who&#39d met at UCLA&#39s film school - met again, unexpectedly, on the beach in Venice, CA, during the summer of 1965.  Though he&#39d never intended to be a singer, Morrison was invited to join Manzarek&#39s group Rick and the Ravens on the strength of his poetry.  Krieger and Densmore, who&#8217d played together in the band Psychedelic Rangers, were recruited soon thereafter though several bassists auditioned of the new collective, none could furnish the bottom end as effectively as Manzarek&#39s left hand.  Taking their name from Aldous Huxley&#39s psychotropic monograph &quotThe Doors of Perception,&quot the band signed to Elektra Records following a now-legendary gig at the Whisky-a-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip.</p><p>Their eponymous first album, released in January 1967, kicked off with &quotBreak on Through (to the Other Side)&quot and also featured the chart smash &quotLight My Fire,&quot the scorching &quotBack Door Man,&quot and the visionary masterpiece &quotThe End.&quot  The Doors arrived fully formed, capable of rocking the pop charts and the avant-garde with one staggering disc.  Before &#3967 was over, they&#39d issued the ambitious follow-up &quotStrange Days,&quot with such gems as &quotLove Me Two Times&quot, &quotPeople Are Strange&quot and &quotWhen the Music&#39s Over&quot.</p><p>Next came 1968&#39s &quotWaiting for the Sun,&quot boasting &quotHello, I Love You&quot, &quotLove Street,&quot and &quotFive to One&quot.  Over the next few years they minded over new territory on such albums as 1969&#39s &quotThe Soft Parade&quot (featuring &quotTouch Me&quot and &quotTell All the People&quot), 1970&#39s &quotMorrison Hotel&quot (which includes &quotRoadhouse Blues&quot, &quotPeace Frog,&quot and &quotQueen of the Highway&quot) and 1971&#39s &quotL.A. Woman&quot (boasting &quotRider&#39s on the Storm&quot, &quotLove Her Madly,&quot and the title track).</p><p>They released six studio albums in all, as well as a live album and a compilation, before Morrison&#39s death in 1971.  Their electrifying achievements in the studio and onstage were unmatched in the annals of rock and though Morrison&#39s death meant the end of an era, Manzarek, Krieger, and Densmore collaborated on two more original Doors albums, &quotOther Voices and Full Circle,&quot and a set of tracks they composed to accompany Morrison&#39s 1969 recording of his poetry, released in 1978 as &quotAn American Prayer.&quot  They also pursued individual music projects, books, theatrical productions and other enterprises - and remain restlessly creative to this day.</p><p>In the decades since the Doors&#39 heyday, the foursome has loomed ever larger in the pantheon of rock - and they remain a touchstone of insurrectionary culture for writers, activists, visual artists and other creative communities.  Their songs, featured in an ever-increasing number of films, TV shows, video games and remixes, always sound uncannily contemporary.  No matter how the musical and cultural tides turn, The Doors will always be ready to help a new wave of listeners break on through to the other side.</p>', 1967, NULL),

(233, 'Solomon Burke', '<p>Biographyby by Richie Unterberger</p><p>While Solomon Burke never made a major impact upon the pop audience -- he never, in fact, had a Top 20 hit -- he was an important early soul pioneer. On his &#3960s singles for Atlantic, he brought a country influence into R&ampB, with emotional phrasing and intricately constructed, melodic ballads and midtempo songs. At the same time, he was surrounded with sophisticated &quotuptown&quot arrangements and was provided with much of his material by his producers, particularly Bert Berns. The combination of gospel, pop, country, and production polish was basic to the recipe of early soul. While Burke wasn&#39t the only one pursuing this path, not many others did so as successfully. And he, like Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, was an important influence upon the Rolling Stones, who covered Burke&#39s &quotCry to Me&quot and &quotEverybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot on their early albums.</p><p>Burke came by his gospel roots even more deeply than most soul stars. He was preaching at his family&#39s Philadelphia church and hosting his own gospel radio show even before he&#39d reached his teens. He began recording gospel and R&ampB sides for Apollo in the mid- to late &#3950s. Like several former gospel singers (Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett), he was molded into a more secular direction when he signed with Atlantic in the &#3960s. Burke had a wealth of high-charting R&ampB hits in the early half of the &#3960s, which crossed over to the pop listings in a mild fashion as well. &quotJust Out of Reach,&quot &quotCry to Me,&quot &quotIf You Need Me,&quot &quotGot to Get You Off My Mind,&quot &quotTonight&#39s the Night,&quot and &quotGoodbye Baby (Baby Goodbye)&quot were the most successful of these, although, unlike Franklin or Pickett, he wasn&#39t able to expand his R&ampB base into a huge pop following as well. He left Atlantic in the late &#3960s and spent the next decade hopping between various labels, getting his biggest hit with a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#39s &quotProud Mary&quot in 1969, and recording an album in the late &#3970s with cult soulster Swamp Dogg as producer.</p><p>From the &#3980s through the first decade of the new millennium, Burke became one of the most visible living exponents of classic soul music, continuing to tour and record albums in a rootsy, at times gospel-ish style. Although these were critically well-received, their stylistic purity also ensured that their market was primarily confined to roots music enthusiasts, rather than a pop audience. His live and later recorded work, however, is a favorite of those who want to experience a soul legend with his talents and stylistic purity relatively intact. Burke&#39s 2002 release Don&#39t Give Up on Me was hailed as a major comeback for the legendary soul man. Great songwriters like Elvis Costello, Dan Penn, Nick Lowe, and Tom Waits contributed songs, and Joe Henry produced the album, which has been compared to Johnny Cash&#39s landmark American Recordings.</p><p>After the critical success of Don&#39t Give Up on Me reaffirmed Burke&#39s status as one of the greatest living exponents of classic soul, the singer teamed up with producer Don Was for Make Do with What You Got, an updated variation on his classic style that was released in spring 2005. A year later, Burke released an interesting country and soul hybrid, Nashville, on Shout! Factory. A second album on the label, Like a Fire, followed in 2008. Burke next reunited with producer Willie Mitchell for Nothing&#8217s Impossible, which was released shortly after Mitchell&#8217s death in 2010 by Koch Records&#8217 E1 Music. Sadly, Burke himself died on October 10, 2010 upon arrival at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, The Netherlands the soul legend was en route to perform at a sold-out show at the city&#39s Paradiso concert hall.</p>', 1992, NULL),

The grooves and production on the album are bass-heavy R&ampB, but Badu&#39s languorous, occasionally tortured vocals and delicate phrasing immediately removed her from the legion of cookie-cutter female R&ampB singers. A singer/songwriter responsible for all but one of the songs on Baduizm, she found a number 12 hit with her first single, &quotOn &amp On,&quot which pushed the album to number two on the charts.</p><p>Born Erica Wright in Dallas in 1971, Badu attended a school of the arts and was working as a teacher and part-time singer in her hometown when she opened for D&#39Angelo at a 1994 show. D&#39Angelo&#39s manager, Kedar Massenburg, was impressed with the performance and hooked her up with the singer to record a cover of the Marvin Gaye/Tammi Terrell duet &quotPrecious Love.&quot He also signed Badu to his recently formed Kedar Entertainment label, and served as producer for Baduizm, which also starred bassist Ron Carter and members of hip-hop avatars the Roots on several tracks. The first single, &quotOn &amp On,&quot became a number one R&ampB hit in early 1997, and Baduizm followed it to the top of the R&ampB album charts by March.

(243, 'Maxwell', '<p>In an age of immediacy the idea of waiting sounds hopelessly outdated. But that said, there is something to be said about anticipation. Such is the case with Maxwell&#8217s new album. Yes, after an extended hiatus the sexy ambassador of soul has returned with a brand new look and a fresh yet deliciously vintage sound. The same artist who brought us classic songs like &#8220Sumthin&#8217 Sumthin&#8217,&#8221 &#8220Ascension (Don&#8217t Ever Wonder)&#8221 and &#8220Lifetime&#8221 (not to mention the unforgettably ethereal cover of Kate Bush&#8217s &#8220This Woman&#8217s Work&#8221) is back with a challenging, mature, sensual, courageous and emotionally open album entitled, BLACKsummers&#8217night (Columbia). BLACKsummers&#8217night , the first installment of a trilogy, is a collection well worth the wait.<br/>His fourth studio album and first in eight years, BLACKsummers&#8217night is the sound of an artist taking the commitment to his craft and the conversation with his audience that much further. Needless to say, it is a conversation that&#8217s been overdue but as the soft-spoken, multi-platinum artist sees it, in order to come back it was necessary to step away. &#8220I wanted to return to &#8216what was the promise?&#8217&#8221 Maxwell offers. &#8220What did my music and creativity speak of to people? For me, coming back to that promise was kind of where my heart was really gravitating towards. I didn&#8217t intentionally step away from all of it, but I just wanted to&#8230live my life a little bit, and then be able to make music with that pure experience again.&#8221<br/>He might have been out of the spotlight, but Maxwell along with long time collaborator and friend Hod David, had begun crafting BLACKsummers&#8217night several years ago. The album is the first installment of a trilogy entitled BLACKSUMMERS&#8217NIGHT. BLACK is a much darker but soulful compilation, SUMMERS&#8217 leans more toward the gospel side and NIGHT is more a cool collection of slow jams. By late 2008, the process of polishing and shaping the album was full on.  Though having much of his creative team on board, Maxwell still approached the creative process with extreme caution and the painstaking meticulousness of a true genius. &#8220Every time I&#8217d get in the studio it would be like am I trying to outdo this last record? I just wanted to make a really good record.&#8221 Of course, what Maxwell&#8217s notoriously modest character failed to warn was that what he was creating was more than &#8220good&#8221 but rather (like his other projects) a timeless piece of work.<br/>Composed of nine indelible songs BLACKsummers&#8217night finds Maxwell exploring life with a bold and purposeful sensuality unmistakably his own. Opening with a delicate hint of wistful chimes, the first single, &#8220Pretty Wings,&#8221 is nostalgic, (&#8220your face will be the reason I smile&#8221) and yet undeniably passionate. &#8220It&#8217s about the last relationship I had,&#8221 Maxwell describes. &#8220How you meet the person of your dreams but at the wrong time. She was a serious muse and the song is a testament to what I wanted to say and say, to her.&#8221 &#8220I can be a bit emotionally handicapped&#8221 he elucidates, &#8220but through music, I can say what I want to.&#8221 Another of the album&#8217s more persuasive songs is &#8220Stop the World.&#8221 A rhythmic rush of desire, Maxwell describes &#8220Stop the World&#8221 as &#8220having corporal relations.&#8221 &#8220That&#8217s what I call having sex&#8230&#8221 he unabashedly reveals &#8220&#8230and that&#8217s stopping the world.&#8221 &#8230Mhmmm.<br/>Equally personal is &#8220Fistful of Tears.&#8221 Pushed along by a sturdy and incessant piano, Maxwell, shifting from those oh so recognizable falsettos and baritones, rides the melody like a man both possessed by and resigned to his feelings. &#8220It&#8217s kind of about wanting to leave the industry and a relationship, but then realizing that I should give it a last try. Don&#8217t let it go.&#8221 Then there&#8217s the jazz thumping &#8220Cold.&#8221 Peppered by a funked up horn section and wrapped in a moist honey soaked groove, this fun, head bopping track finds Maxwell asking the eternal lovers question, &#8220why do you like me like you do?&#8221 It&#8217s very sexy stuff.<br/>On June 24th Maxwell galvanized an unsuspecting audience at the 2008 BET Awards with a live rendition of Al Green&#8217s classic song, &#8220Simply Beautiful.&#8221 It would be his first live performance in seven years. Without his signature afro or silk mono-chromatic suit, it was hard to tell if this six-foot tall body was merely a mirage or indeed the man that for so many years had left legions of devoted fans wanting more. But after uttering the first gentle lyric (&#8220If I gave you my love&#8230&#8221) everyone remembered and so did Maxwell. The unforgettable performance became one of the most talked about in 2008. It left each audience member (regular folk and superstar celebrities alike) rejoicing that unquestionably authentic soul sound that was denied to them for far too long. Overwhelmed and inspired by the ecstatically warm response, Maxwell decided to boldly hit the road, with no album, nor concrete plan to follow. Less than two months later the artist announced the launch of his much speculated 2008 BLACKSUMMERS&#8217NIGHT tour. Maxwell initiated the tour with his first concert at South Africa&#8217s Macufe Music Festival. Maxwell sold out 10,000 seats and was given honorary South African citizenship. The show, which aired on &#8220BET&#8217s Access Granted,&#8221 was not only his first concert (as well as on-air interview) in seven years it was his first show ever in South Africa.<br/>In the U.S., all 144,000 tickets for the tour sold out within minutes of their on-sale date. An overwhelming demand for Maxwell caused the original 26-date tour to be extended to 33 dates. He performed in all the major cities including New York selling out the renowned Radio City Music Hall and uptown New York&#8217s 3,000 seat theater, The United Palace. New York Times writer Jon Caramanica asserts, &#8220Maxwell has something that his emulators lack: complexity&#8230some of the most potent moments [at Radio City] came in the pregnant spaces between notes, with Maxwell managing to hold a feeling even with his mouth shut.&#8221<br/>For Maxwell the opportunity to get back on stage and receive such an enormous response, especially without an album to support, was revelatory and further inspired him to complete his oft delayed album. &#8220That experience is something for which I am beyond grateful. To be able to take a risk and to have that genuine interest from people is so rare. It actually made making this record even more precious. It was that pure energy. It was like, &#8216oh, this is why I do it.&#8217 It&#8217s because people care about real music and they&#8217ll wait for you.&#8221<br/>In 1996, a then 23-year old Brooklyn born phenomenon took the music world by storm with his debut, Urban Hang Suite. (He signed to Columbia Records at the tender age of 21, already having composed more than 300 songs before signing on to the major label.) The critically acclaimed CD received a Grammy nomination for Best R&ampB Album and went on to achieve double platinum status. Maxwell&#8217s MTV: Unplugged (1997) achieved gold status with his live rendition of &#8220This Woman&#8217s Work.&#8221  He was heralded as the future of soul music and proved his staying power when he followed up with 1998&#8217s platinum seller Embrya. In 1999 Maxwell&#8217s single, &#8220Fortunate&#8221 (off of the LIFE soundtrack) became Billboard magazine&#8217s number one hit of the year. Maxwell&#8217s third album, Now (2001) debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Album Chart selling 300,000 copies its maiden week and eventually also reaching double platinum status. The album was appropriately described by Entertainment Weekly as &#8220A velvetined gauntlet thrown at the feet of today&#8217s bling-bling-obsessed R&ampB pack.&#8221<br/>To hear Maxwell explain it, as much as his fans were waiting for him, he was waiting for them-and in the process of finding himself. &#8220Sometimes I can&#8217t believe I do this because you&#8217re living your life. Going to the corner store, taking out the garbage and the next thing you know you&#8217re on stage at Radio City Music Hall. It&#8217s such a humbling thing and you&#8217d think it would make my ego go out of control but I feel humility. Like this is why I need to do this. It&#8217s not about your ego. It&#8217s about celebrating your opportunity and the blessing to work and the joy you can possibly bring to people. That&#8217s how it all resonated with me.&#8221<br/>A constant throughout  BLACKsummers&#8217night is its live and often raw sound. The entire album was recorded with an extraordinary live ten-piece band. He is taking it back to when a solo genius artist offered music that was close to perfection. No synthesizers, no duets. Just Maxwell bare and in the flesh ready to give old fans and new ones a sensory experience that he never fails to bring.</p>', 1996, NULL),

Boyz II Men weave these diverse selections together into an album-length symphony, one that flows seamlessly from an impassioned &#8220I Can&#8217t Make You Love Me&#8221 through the shimmering a cappella sound of &#8220Time After Time&#8221 to &#8220When I Fall In Love,&#8221 a beautiful reworking of a great American standard featuring Boyz II Men&#8217s special guest Michael Bubl&#233.</p><p>Love is the successor to Boyz II Men&#8217s Decca label debut, Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA (Decca/Universal), released November 13, 2007. This collection of Detroit soul classics took the interna&#172tional music scene by storm to a degree that surprised even the group members. Motown rose to No. 27 on the Billboard Top 200 and to No. 6 on the trade&#8217s R&ampB Albums chart proportionately, sales in Europe and other territories were even stronger than in the U.S. The album earned two Grammy Award nomina&#172tions, for &#8220Best R&ampB Album&#8221 and &#8220Best R&ampB Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocals&#8221 (for the Stevie Wonder cover &#8220Ribbons In The Sky&#8221) and sparked the release of Boyz II Men&#8217s first full-length live concert DVD, Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA &#8211 Live (Decca/Universal, released 12/9/07).</p><p>&#8220The success of Motown definitely upped our visibility insofar as being able to tour more, in bigger venues, in more cities and more countries,&#8221 says Shawn Stockman. &#8220We were already an international touring company&#8221 &#8211 in a typical 12-month period, Boyz II Men performs 150-200 concerts around the world &#8211 &#8220but Motown helped extend our reach even further.&#8221</p><p>&#8220The beautiful thing was that we already had shows booked in Europe and Japan, as we&#8217ve done almost every year for many years,&#8221 Wanya Morris explains. &#8220But performing the Motown songs was the best album promotion we could have done. And we felt the same effect back in the States as we did overseas, even in places like Billings, Montana and Salt Lake City, Utah.</p><p>&#8220The excitement that built up as we went along through 2008 was reminiscent of the old days. The audience doesn&#8217t forget, necessarily, but the audience sometimes needs to be reminded.&#8221<br/>Nate Morris says simply: &#8220Our fan base came back. A lot of them didn&#8217t know what we&#8217d been up to for the past eight or ten years. Motown put the awareness out that there that Boyz II Men were still around, still making quality music &#8211 it launched us into a new future.&#8221</p><p>Even before the group&#8217s months of touring came to an end, Boyz II Men and their creative team were brainstorming the next album. Nate Morris was the first to advocate for the theme of Love: &#8220There were a couple of different ideas raised beforehand &#8211 a doo-wop album, an Eighties album, a Motown II album &#8211 but I never felt really comfortable until we hit on the Love concept. That is the feeling that Boyz II Men have been giving our listeners since the beginning.&#8221</p><p>&#8220People would have expected us to do a whole bunch of R&ampB love songs: Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye, the Isley Brothers,&#8221 says Wanya. &#8220Now that repertoire certainly would not have made for a bad album, but it would&#8217ve made for a more limited album. In going for classic love songs period &#8211 not just R&ampB, not just pop, but music &#8211 we made an album that challenged us.&#8221</p><p>&#8220We didn&#8217t know how it would work at first,&#8221 adds Shawn, &#8220because the repertoire is so wide-ranging. Fortunately, it all came together &#8211 and better than I expected, personally. I really didn&#8217t think it was gonna fly! But as we started picking the songs and got into recording, as we heard how the arrangements came together, then I was like, &#8216okay, now I understand this.&#8217</p><p>Working mainly in two Los Angeles studios (Henson and Westlake), Randy Jackson a core band to play on all twelve tracks of Love. (Track 13 is the a cappella version of Cyndi Lauper&#8217s &#8220Time After Time.&#8221) Most of the musicians &#8211 including drummer Michael Bland, bassist Lloyd &#8220Sonny&#8221 Thompson, and guitarist Mike Scott &#8211 are current or former accompanists with that most demanding of musical taskmas&#172ters, Prince.</p><p>&#8220That&#8217s another element that made it a great recording process,&#8221 Stockman recalls, &#8220because these guys were already a real band. They knew exactly what to do, they each knew how the others played -- and we got to hear a couple of good Prince stories!&#8221</p><p>The vocal arrangements for a Boyz II Men album &#8220are not something that can be done by just one person or even two of us,&#8221 says Nate. &#8220It&#8217s the totality of the group. One of us may hear one approach to the song and another guy may hear a different approach, but by the time we get to the end of the process, every&#172one&#8217s had their input.&#8221</p><p>The trio&#8217s heavy touring commitments meant that time was of the essence in the creation of Love. &#8220Here again, I think we showed that Boyz II Men is a group to be reckoned with,&#8221 Wanya declares proudly. &#8220We had a full touring schedule and a limited amount of time for the studio &#8211 and the results made some people say, &#8216wow, they made this album in two months? An album of this caliber, from the basic band tracks to final mastering &#8211 how was this group able to do that?&#8217&#8221</p><p>As Nate, Wanya, and Shawn look ahead to their 20th anniversary, they reflect on the things that have kept Boyz II Men not just together over two decades but on track in pursuit of new career highs and horizons.</p><p>Shawn Stockman: &#8220I think it&#8217s respect: respect for each other&#8217s abilities, for what we each bring to the table, respect for each other as men. We try to give each other space, room to breathe, room to grow &#8211 because we&#8217re not just Boyz II Men, we&#8217re also husbands and fathers, sons and brothers, members of our communities. At this point, there are no egos: We know we all built this thing together and we&#8217re all in it together.&#8221</p><p>Wanya Morris: &#8220I believe what&#8217s kept us standing is our love for the music, our respect for one another, and our love for God&#8230The connection that we have is like a marriage &#8211 and a marriage is supposed to be forever. Music brought us together and music keeps us together. To be able to finish each other&#8217s phrases and each other&#8217s ad-libs &#8211 that&#8217s a bond &#8216no man can tear asunder,&#8217 so to speak. Anyone who listens to a Boyz II Men album like Love or who comes to see a Boyz II Men show, they&#8217ll feel that passion, that connection between us.&#8221</p><p>Nate Morris: &#8220It&#8217s all about the songs. We got together as a group because we loved the way we sounded together. We turned people into Boyz II Men fans not because of the bowties, not because of the dance steps, but because of the songs. A group can last as long for as its songs, and the songs on Love are as strong as any we&#8217ve ever sung.&#8221</p>', 1993, NULL),

(255, 'Barenaked Ladies', '<p>Imagine a shrine for all great sayings, a Pop Psychology Hall of Fame if you will. On these special walls you&#39d find such stalwarts as &quotWhat Doesn&#39t Kill You Makes You Stronger,&quot &quotTomorrow&#39s Another Day&quot and &quotEverything Happens For A Reason.&quot Right over there the &quotLight At The End of The Tunnel&quot stands next to &quotThe Great Unknown.&quot Sure, these sayings are ubiquitous repeated down through the ages as mantra for some, clich&#233 for others. But now, after 20 years together, Barenaked Ladies are taking time to walk these halls and learn from another bon mot, All In Good Time.<br/>Yes, All In Good Time is the name of the new album, the 11th from this Canadian institution, and their first as a new four-piece. Fourteen bold and adventurous new tracks, recorded in Toronto in the spring and summer of 2009, find Ed Robertson (guitar/vocals), Jim Creeggan (bass/vocals), Kevin Hearn (keyboard/guitar/vocals) and Tyler Stewart (drums/vocals) exploring a very creative and fertile phase of their careers.</p><p>&quotThere was a little more room for people to breathe on this record&quot says Robertson. &quotIt&#39s more rocking in places and it stretches out and becomes more spacious in others. It was a really good feeling in the studio, with everyone very comfortable together and Michael at the helm.&quot</p><p>Robertson is referring to ace producer and long-time BNL collaborator Michael Phillip Wojewoda, who produced the band&#39s very first full length CD, 1992&#39s Gordon. Wojewoda jumped at the chance to capture the group&#39s rebirth as a quartet. &quotThe newness of the situation inspired the band to stretch musically,&quot says Wojewoda. &quotEven though there were challenges, they jumped in headfirst with enthusiasm and passion. The results are very exciting. It was great to be part of that.&quot</p><p>The move from five to four could be a tough transition for a lesser group, but Barenaked Ladies are no ordinary rock band. Founded as a duo in 1988 by schoolmates Ed Robertson and Steven Page, the group soon grew to five members and took Canada by storm with their five-song indie cassette, The Yellow Tape. Over the next decade-plus, their albums Gordon, Rock Spectacle, Stunt and Maroon went multi-platinum in the U.S., and Barenaked Ladies became a top-selling, award-winning concert draw across North America and The U.K. with their frenetic blend of high-energy melodic-pop, crack musicianship and spontaneous repartee.</p><p>Ed Robertson, the primary songwriter since the birth of the band, took a moment to share how the writing process for All In Good Time was different from past Barenaked Ladies albums. &quotThis was a chance for me to shed some of my writing dependencies, both good and bad, and explore new ground. I allowed myself to go places that I might not have in the past. I was more literal at times, and more abstract at others, pushing the self-imposed limits I&#39d adhered to for too long. The writing was cathartic for me in a way that writing hadn&#39t been since the early nineties. It had been a huge and often dark year: an arrest, a plane crash and the death of my mother. All of these things took a heavy toll on my psyche, and spurred a lot of serious exploring.&quot</p><p>Regarding the line-up change in Barenaked Ladies, Robertson is very candid: &quotOur relationship with Steve Page was great and very fruitful. It lasted almost 20 years, but it was time to move on. Now we&#39re doing something that feels really fresh and exciting to me. His departure left four singers and three multi-instrumentalists in the band, so we&#39re not lacking for musical ideas, and now there&#39s more room for the other writers in the band to bring songs to the table.&quot</p><p>The results of Robertson&#39s personal explorations can be heard in the standout first track/lead single &quotYou Run Away,&quot a story of missed opportunities and remorse: &quotI tried to be your brother / You cried and ran for cover/ I made a mess, who doesn&#39t? / I did my best but it wasn&#39t enough.&quot</p><p>In the brisk, angular rocker &quotHow Long,&quot Robertson kicks off the lines &quotGive it up for Anger, it makes us strong!&quot another echo of recent years for the famous father of three.</p><p>On the power-pop &quotEvery Subway Car,&quot the founding singer/guitarist takes on the angst of a love-struck guerilla artiste: &quotSoon the world will see / Our graffiti love/ Belton on my glove/ They&#39ll wonder who you are on every subway car.&quot</p><p>Finally, Robertson finds three rhymes for the apparently unrhymable word Orange in a Django Reinhardt meets Jay-Z beer-hall sing-along called &quotFour Seconds&quot: &quotOh Flip, The light is turning Orange / Coat ripped, when I caught it in the door hinge/ I slipped when the lady in the 4 inch / Bought it in a store in Germany.&quot Even after a couple of years of ups and downs, Barenaked Ladies have hung on to their abstract senses of humour.</p><p>For bassist Jim Creeggan, who sings the jaunty &quotOn The Look Out&quot and the soulful &quotI Saw It,&quot the latter a meditation on teenaged bullying, the current version of Barenaked Ladies is breaking important new ground: &quotI think the band is moving forward with a clearer collective understanding of who we are, and what is at stake. Leaving Steve was one of the hardest things we&#39ve had to do and we each had to weigh in on why the band was important enough for us to continue. We came to the conclusion that the band was only worth saving if we supported one another and strove for a healthy dynamic between us. So far it&#39s been amazing and the most creative time I can remember having with the group.&quot</p><p>Multi-instrumentalist Kevin Hearn echoes Creeggan&#39s notions of personal and creative growth within the band. Hearn brought three new songs to the table for All In Good Time: the symphonic &quotAnother Heartbreak,&quot the surreal ghost town travelogue &quotJerome&quot and the luxuriously groovy &quotWatching The Northern Lights,&quot all of which showcase his unique, fragile voice. &quotI brought my songs in with sketches of how I heard them,&quot says the former St. Michael&#39s choirboy. &quotThey were further shaped by the guys and MPW&#39s input. I didn&#39t try to write `BNL&#39 songs, per se, rather I just tried to write songs that felt honest to me, and I knew they would be in good hands within the band.&quot</p><p>The result of new contributions from within is a recording that is stylistically adventurous, musically diverse and the most emotionally riveting and honest work by the band to date.</p><p>&quotWe had a bizarre year in 08,&quot says drummer and vocalist Tyler Stewart. &quotA lot of upheaval, a lot of changes, but 12 months later we&#39re stronger than we&#39ve ever been. We had to dig deep and redefine ourselves. Right now it feels really, really good to be in Barenaked Ladies.&quot</p>', 1992, NULL),

(262, 'New Pornographers', '<p>THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS    Together<br/>We Are Together, by Rick Moody<br/>For what purpose the popular song? Does the popular song have a purpose? Is it just a sequence of auditory gestures, desperate acts, adrift in the bigger broader silence of an unforgiving cultural landscape? In what follows, we will assume that the purpose of the popular song is to unite warring disputants and to repair the manifold puncture wounds of life, so that life is revealed, again, as less accursed than it appears. And let&#8217s assume that we go on listening to the popular song, which in the vast majority of its iterations is a failure, because we are chronic in our need for this rehabilitation of our puncture-wounded selves. Take any fine example, take &#8220All You Need Is Love,&#8221 by the Beatles, or &#8220Walk Away, Renee,&#8221 by the Left Banke, or &#8220Tears of a Clown,&#8221 by Smokey Robinson. Try listening to these songs. Almost immediately, your suppurations begin to clot.<br/>Into this tryingly difficult history of the popular song stride The New Pornographers, into a period in which it has to be acknowledged that the medium is mostly dead, is passed, is no longer a uniting force, but, more frequently, a medium of division, one entirely controlled by the Ownership Society and made profitable according to shareholders who don&#8217t give a fuck if your puncture wounds are healed over as long as the product ships. The New Pornographers, stunningly, do not seem to understand that the popular song is dead, is passed, and The New Pornographers, despite their complete and nearly monastic understanding of the Secret Knowledge of the popular song, will themselves into being, characterized by a uniform devotion to the great history that precedes them by only a couple of decades, and their coming into being in a somewhat unlikely place, Vancouver, not previously noted for a unvarying profusion of rock genius, is particular not only for uniformity of purpose but because they manage, in this uniformity, to bring a considerable cast of local adepts all as one into the tent. The cast of adepts is now well known, but includes at least two startlingly good songwriters, three spectacularly good singers, one of the very best drummers in all of contemporary music, an in-house filmmaker&#8212and that is merely to scratch the surface on the question of bench strength, the shocking amount of bench strength in a band in which everyone seems to be able to produce quality audio emanations from any instrument and to sing, and in which the studio is an instrument as it is in few bands.<br/>Their first album is great, and is power pop, power pop, and more power pop, their second album (Electric Version) refines the form and tinkers, with more studio brilliance on display, the third, viz., Twin Cinema, is an artier thing and a proggier thing, revealing a breadth of confidence, and a breadth of confidences, both senses, and a command of lyrical nuance and anthemic talents that display themselves in unusual spots, in songs that don&#8217t begin anthemically, but which then reveal urgencies Challengers, the fourth, has some quieter annunciations on it, seems to come from a place of adulthood, from a recognition that urgency can be in the theme, and the affirmation of the song is not in the lyric necessarily, but in the commitment, in the commitment to the sonnet-like cadences of the popular song, and the title song herein, &#8220Challengers,&#8221 a miniature about a romantic entanglement that literally walks past the narrator, takes us far beyond the adolescences of the popular song into the adult spot where really great songwriters begin to ply their craft.<br/>Which brings us to the ineradicable present, which is the moment when The New Pornographers have already done everything they can do, in some senses they have had songs in films and on television, they have toured the world, they are respected and covered and well reviewed and lionized, and everyone in the band has a justifiably earned reputation for excellence and admirability, chief among them A.

Newman, first among equals with respect to these musical bulletins, Neko Case, the singer who never met a line of lyrics that she could not in same way make indelible, and Dan Bejar, the stealth member and interpretation-resistant Mandarin troubadour.</p><p>There are no more interesting rock and roll bands, you know, there are opiate-addicted white boys who cannot play very well and who are unwilling to turn down the amplifiers so as to be heard, and there are machines and auto-tuned fembots, and there are hip hoppers with public-relations simulated gangster simulations, and there are working-class guys with a lot of tattoos who can play really, really fast. But there are no more interesting rock and roll bands, and there are no longer songs that make you want to get out of bed. Still, The New Pornographers are unable not to behave like underdogs of yearning, like a united front of yearning, and they are also unable, it seems, to resist the challenge to make a perfect album, a form so dead that it is on its seventh wave of maggotry, and so they have an eye on history, and they do love a windmill, they love to charge, and they do not know how to do otherwise now, which means that theirs is a contagious form of yearning, and if in part their longing is postmodern, which is to say that they often writes songs that are about other songs (&#8220Crash Years,&#8221 e.g., is about &#8220You&#8221 by George Harrison, and &#8220Moves&#8221 is, in part, about &#822025 or 6 to 4,&#8221 by the beleaguered Chicago), they are not able to treat the form simply as a kind of commentary (which has caused others fatefully to go awry), but also as a surgical intervention for puncture-wounded civilians everywhere, as a joy delivery-system, and in this joy-delivery system there are new and interesting twists, for those who are curious about what the ineradicable contemporary moment sounds like, sound-wise, and the twists on this new album, have to do with strings, really, and with a sort of chamber pop orientation, lots of  cello, that is, of a sort that calls to mind the amazing Sister Lovers LP by Big Star, around whose open wounds A. C. Newman has orbited in the past but more fearfully than now.<br/>Fewer keyboard flourishes, and fewer things that sound like they necessitated a good computer programmer, and more things that sound like A. C. Newman and the rest of the band playing in a room. This is probably an illusion, this playing together, but it is an illusion with a purpose, because there are at least two songs on this album that use togetherness as the assembling cement, the epoxy of their composition. The first of these is a big rock song, &#8220Your Hands (Together),&#8221 and as you would expect the putting of hands together also occasions a silver bullet, of the mortally inflicting variety, which is the paradoxical sort of thematic approach that we would expect from songwriters who are no longer young, and who are willing to write a couplet that answers the question &#8220What&#8217s love?&#8221 with the response: &#8220What turns up in the dark.&#8221 All of this is perforation for the tearing away of the final track, &#8220We Get Together,&#8221 in which the hook, the title, is at the very end, buried in the mix, and the whole is about familial dynamics, much in the way that &#8220Oh, Sister,&#8221 from Bob Dylan&#8217s Desire is about familial dynamics, which is to say not at all, and more about the injunction to &#8220do damage&#8221 than it is about familiar unity, &#8220I&#8217m for damage, sweet damage,&#8221 Newman and Case sing, and the cellos come back around, with their genteel bolshevism, with a hint of the early Electric Light Orchestra, and Carl goes in and out of his falsetto as he does when he&#8217s winding up like a violent debater, and they hold back on the drumming, which is what they do, until it&#8217s absolutely necessary, and that is a big advantage when the drummer is this great, and then we come to the out chorus, in which Case seems to be singing &#8220ma ma ma ma,&#8221 as if to mislead you into thinking that the song, is about familial dynamics, and Newman sings &#8220we end up together,&#8221 and then there is guitar feedback. End credits.<br/>What does he mean about ending up together? What would it mean for a popular song, while clearly supporting an aesthetic palette devoted to &#8220sweet damage,&#8221 nonetheless to support the idea of ending up together? Is it, paradoxically, about the kind of romantic failure that makes for all the best popular songs? Is it a recognition that the only unifying that can come from the contemporary popular song is the kind of togetherness that recognizes the truth of human life, namely that all is apartness, and all is lonesomeness, and this even if the principle songwriter in the band is recently married, and, by all evidence, reasonably content? Yes, it&#8217s all about the ship going down, and the rats leaping from the sinking vessel, the vessel of the popular song, and there is nothing to do but to celebrate a recognition of this rats-going-down business, and, nonetheless, to view the articulation of same as a joy and a responsibility, such that the best joy-delivery system is the song itself, so that the medium is dead and yet is being used to celebrate its death, and it&#8217s in our mutual recognition of apartness that we are most together. (The band setting is no different, in this way, from quotidian human life. It is a triumph over the entropic energy that would drive it, the band, apart.)<br/>This is an eschatological approach, and, indeed, some of what you are hearing on Together, by the New Pornographers, is a band of ghosts who are mining their fin de si&#232cle imagery for all its worth, even though we are at the beginning of a century. They are from Vancouver (mostly), they still believe that they have something to say, they are adults, they don&#8217t use drum machines, they are not emcees. What could they possibly have going for them? Everything they stand for is over, they are the last iteration, they are the bitter end, the sweet aftertaste of something intoxicating. And yet they believe in doing it, still, together. We are so much the better for it.</p>', 2000, NULL),

(273, 'Incubus', '<p>&quot(Art)... rescues us from our self chosen triviality, to which we are so prone. It is like a deep organ note that makes my hair stir and a shiver run through me. I &#39pull back&#39 from life, like a camera taking a long shot with a wide angle lens. I quite simply become aware of more reality than before.&quot -Colin Wilson (The Occult)</p><p>When I first read this quote, it truly effected me. I felt like someone had finally spoken an iota of truth about creativity and the process it allows to both the creator and the observer. It helped certainties that I have held dear for so long, resonate even deeper within me. And it inevitably made me muse about what we do as a band and group of friends who come together and through a symbiotic chaos of sorts make art and sound. The gratitude I and my friends feel is beyond measure. Gratitude for the experience itself and gratitude to the people who have lent us their attention, if even for three and half minutes.</p><p>Now on our sixth album, we (Incubus) have been writing music together long enough that there is a sense of perspective available that has only come to us with time. Some of our earlier works, though pure and even fun at times, lent to a sense of disorganization a readily apparent lack of focus in my opinion. I have always said, &quotYeah, we suck...but we&#39re really good at it!&quot</p><p>&#39Light Grenades&#39 is a very new perspective for Incubus. Working, once again, with Super Producer, &#39Brendan O&#39Brien&#39, we spent more time crafting, and sculpting these songs than we ever have historically. Every album we had ever made was written in eight weeks and recorded in eight weeks. A long time by some standards, but alarmingly brief by most. It&#39s not that we were rushed, we just like working quickly. We wrote twenty-something songs during this sitting. Like proof readers on meth, we devoured songs and only let them live if they excited, surprised and inspired us all! In a nut shell, it took about a year.</p><p>&#39Dig&#39 was toiled over the most I remember because it is the kind of song that is completely new to us. Structurally, integrally, and fundamentally different. And thank- f***ing- God. Lyrically, it&#39s a nod to camaraderie. And without pepperin&#39 ya&#39lls interpretation of it too much, it speaks to the importance of forgiveness and compassion. Little alien concepts that some choose to toy with on occasion.</p><p>&#39A Kiss to Send Us Off&#39 shows Incubus in our most primal incarnation. It floors you but simultaneously leaves you thinking. But seriously, that song puts my balls in a vacuum cleaner hose and turns the power to 12. It hurts sometimes, but it leaves my balls satisfied and clean. Think about THAT!</p><p>&#39Anna-Molly&#39 delivers a similar push but has a far more sophisticated bent, in that it rocks, but conjures imagery of a girl that I can see in my minds eye but most likely doesn&#39t exist. Therefore being a bit of an anomaly. I guess that is relatively sophisticated...right? f***. I actually hate trying to explain what these or any of our songs mean! And it&#39s really not fair for me to condescend to do that in the first place. If you care to, let them be about whatever you want. Our single, &#39Megalomaniac&#39 from our last album (A Crow Left Of the Murder) was interpreted in ways that I never intended. It wasn&#39t far from home base, but was nowhere near as case specific as it seemed. Which is fine with us. Good! Think of it what you will. And for doG&#39s sake, start your own band!</p><p>While home over the past two years, we had a chance to unpack for the first time in almost a decade. Isn&#39t it interesting that to so many people we are a new band, while we have been writing music together, for better or worse, for fifteen years now. Coming home in November of 2004 was an important decision. Not only were we road weary and dried up, but each one of us in his own way needed to step back from the monster that we had created and re-access what had transpired.</p><p>Michael Einziger, in his down time, wrote original music for a surf documentary entitled &#39Flow&#39 (Directed by Josh Landon) and was nominated at XDance film festival for best original score. I peed on the same tree as well, but lent my speaking voice to narrate the story of said documentary. And yes, I sounded f***ing sexy. Michael also lent his producing skills to his brother&#39s band, Agent Sparks, and is also currently involved with the scores of several motion pictures.</p><p>I have been feverishly working on the follow up to my self published book entitled, &#39White Fluffy Clouds&#39, and expect the newbie to be available for criticism by December of 2006. &#39From the Murks of the Sultry Abyss&#39 is a compendium of images both real and unreal painted, photographed, scratched and typed.</p><p>Jose Pasillas has been exploring his love of art in mixed mediums from canvas, to computer and everything in between. And by day he happily frolics through the grasslands of his hometown with his two feline friends. (Total hippy.)</p><p>DJ Chris Kilmore spent the past few years expanding upon his already stellar reputation as a world class DJ by learning and incorporating a bevy of new instruments into our fold. Turntables, the Theremin, and Moog keys have been creeping into our collective via Chris for some time. But the Guitar-o-phone, Mellotron, Fender Roads, and the kitchen sink are welcomed suprises! Thanks Kil.</p><p>Ben Kenney has been writing music and performing with his side project, &#39The Division Group&#39, and produced the latest album from a young band called &#39The Smyrk&#39.</p><p>All this and we still managed to conceive and carry out what I believe to be our most worthy album to date. If ever asked which album I preferred personally in our arsenal of sound, I would invariably tell you that I most liked whatever was the latest. But this time, I really mean it!</p><p>I think I can speak for my band when I say that we are interested in movement, experimentation and freedom. Being in this band has allowed us the freedom to move in and around other artistic endeavors. Like meandering streams we each wandered off over the past two years only to be drawn unconsciously back to the ocean where all streams converge. And thus composed &#39Light Grenades&#39, our sixth studio album.</p><p>What I am getting at (sort of) is that art has rescued us in many ways. Through circumstance, chance, good fortune, a teeny, weeny bit of talent, and an ardor for expressivity, Incubus has survived long enough to garnish a perspective onto itself. &quotLike a camera taking a long shot with a wide angle lens,&quot we conjured &#39Light Grenades&#39 a forty-seven and some odd seconds long bulbous mass of sound and intention captured on tape. &#39Light Grenades&#39 that explode with consciousness, light, art and mind. If you enjoy it, we thank you. If not? Then my dog is French and he already pooped under your pillow.</p><p>-Brandon</p>', 1995, NULL),

(279, 'Bob Marley', '<p>Bob Marley was a hero figure, in the classic mythological sense. His departure from this planet came at a point when his vision of One World, One Love -- inspired by his belief in Rastafari -- was beginning to be heard and felt. The last Bob Marley and the Wailers tour in 1980 attracted the largest audiences at that time for any musical act in Europe.</p><p>Bob&#39s story is that of an archetype, which is why it continues to have such a powerful and ever-growing resonance: it embodies political repression, metaphysical and artistic insights, gangland warfare and various periods of mystical wilderness. And his audience continues to widen: to westerners Bob&#39s apocalyptic truths prove inspirational and life-changing in the Third World his impact goes much further. Not just among Jamaicans, but also the Hopi Indians of New Mexico and the Maoris of New Zealand, in Indonesia and India, and especially in those parts of West Africa from wihch slaves were plucked and taken to the New World, Bob is seen as a redeemer figure returning to lead this.</p><p>In the clear Jamaican sunlight you can pick out the component parts of which the myth of Bob Marley is comprised: the sadness, the love, the understanding, the Godgiven talent. Those are facts. And although it is sometimes said that there are no facts in Jamaica, there is one more thing of which we can be certain: Bob Marley never wrote a bad song. He left behind the most remarkable body of recorded work. &quotThe reservoir of music he has left behind is like an encyclopedia,&quot says Judy Mowatt of the I-Threes. &quotWhen you need to refer to a certain situation or crisis, there will always be a Bob Marley song that will relate to it. Bob was a musical prophet.&quot</p><p>The tiny Third World country of Jamaica has produced an artist who has transcended all categories, classes, and creeds through a combination of innate modesty and profound wisdom. Bob Marley, the Natural Mystic, may yet prove to be the most significant musical artist of the twentieth century.</p><p>Bob Marley gave the world brilliant and evocative music his work stretched across nearly two decades and yet still remains timeless and universal. Bob Marley &amp the Wailers worked their way into the very fabric of our lives.</p><p>&quotHe&#39s taken his place alongside James Brown and Sly Stone as a pervasive influence on R &amp B&quot, says the American critic Timothy White, author of the acclaimed Bob Marley biography CATCH A FIRE: THE LIFE OF BOB MARLEY. &quotHis music was pure rock, in the sense that it was a public expression of a private truth.&quot</p><p>It is important to consider the roots of this legend: the first superstar from the Third World, Bob Marley was one of the most charismatic and challenging performers of our time and his music could have been created from only one source: the street culture of Jamaica.</p><p>The days of slavery are a recent folk memory on the island. They have permeated the very essence of Jamaica&#39s culture, from the plantation of the mid-nineteenth century to the popular music of our own times.</p><p>Although slavery was abolished in 1834, the Africans and their descendants developed their own culture with half-remembered African traditions mingled with the customs of the British.</p><p>This hybrid culture, of course, had parallels with the emerging black society in America. Jamaica, however, remained a rural community which, without the industrialisation of its northern neighbour, was more closely rooted to its African legacy.</p><p>By the start of the twentieth century that African heritage was given political expression by Marcus Garvey, a shrewd Jamaican preacher and entrepreneur who founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The organisation advocated the creation of a new black state in Africa, free from white domination. As the first step in this dream, Garvey founded the Black Star Line, a steamship company which, in popular imagination at least, was to take the black population from America and the Caribbean back to their homeland of Africa.</p><p>A few years later, in 1930, Ras Tafari Makonnen was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia and took a new name, Haile Selassie, The Emperor claimed to be the 225th ruler in a line that stretched back to Menelik, the son of Solomon and Sheba.</p><p>The Marcus Garvey followers in Jamaica, consulting their New Testaments for a sign, believed Haile Selassie was the black king whom Garvey had prophesied would deliver the Negro race. It was the start of a new religion called Rastafari.</p><p>Fifteen years later, in Rhoden Hall to the north of Jamaica, Bob Marley was born. His mother was an eighteen-year-old black girl called Cedella Booker while his father was Captain Norval Marley, a 50-year-old white quartermaster attached to the British West Indian Regiment.</p><p>The couple married in 1944 and Robert Nesta Marley was born on February 6, 1945. Norval Marley&#39s family, however, applied constant pressure and, although he provided financial support, the Captain seldom saw his son who grew up in the rural surroundings of St. Ann to the north of the island.</p><p>For country people in Jamaica, the capital Kingston was the city of their dreams, the land of opportunity. The reality was that Kingston had little work to offer, yet through the Fifties and Sixties, people flooded to the city. The newcomers, despite their rapid disillusion with the capital, seldom returned to the rural parishes. Instead, they squatted in the shanty towns that grew up in western Kingston, the most notorious of which was Trench town (so named because it was built over a ditch that drained the sewage of old Kingston.)</p><p>Bob Marley, barely into his teens, moved to Kingston in the late Fifties. Like many before them, Marley and his mother eventually settled in Trenchtown. His friends were other street youths, also impatient with their place in Jamaican society. One friend in particular was Neville O&#39Riley Livingston, known as Bunny, with whom Bob took his first hesitant musical steps.</p><p>The two youths were fascinated by the extraordinary music they could pick up from American radio stations. In particular there was one New Orleans station broadcasting the latest tunes by such artists as Ray Charles, Fats Domino, Curtis Mayfield and Brook Benton. Bob and Bunny also paid close attention to the black vocal groups, such as the Drifters, who were extremely popular in Jamaica.</p><p>When Bob quit school he seemed to have but one ambition: music. Although he took a job in a welding shop, Bob spent all his free time with Bunny, perfecting their vocal abilities. They were helped by one of Trench Town&#39s famous residents, the singer Joe Higgs who held informal lessons for aspiring vocalists in the tenement yards. It was at one of those sessions that Bob and Bunny met Peter McIntosh, another youth with big musical ambitions.</p><p>In 1962 Bob Marley auditioned for a local music entrepreneur called Leslie Kong. Impressed by the quality of Bob&#39s vocals, Kong took the young singer into the studio to cut some tracks, the first of which, called &quotJudge Not&quot, was released on Beverley&#39s label. It was Marley&#39s first record.<br/>The other tunes -- including &quotTerror&quot and &quotOne Cup of Coffee&quot -- received no airplay and attracted little attention. At the very least, however, they confirmed Marley&#39s ambition to be a singer. By the following year Bob had decided the way forward was with a group. He linked up with Bunny and Peter to form The Wailing Wailers.</p><p>The new group had a mentor, a Rastafarian hand drummer called Alvin Patterson, who introduced the youths to Clement Dodd, a record producer in Kingston. In the summer of 1963 Dodd auditioned The Wailing Wailers and, pleased with the results, agreed to record the group.</p><p>It was the time of ska music, the hot new dance floor music with a pronounced back-beat. Its origins incorporated influences from Jamaica&#39s African traditions but, more immediately, from the heady beats of New Orleans&#39 rhythm &amp blues disseminated from American radio stations and the burgeoning sound systems on the streets of Kingston. Clement - Sir Coxsone - Dodd was one of the city&#39s finest sound system men.</p><p>The Wailing Wailers released their first single, &quotSimmer Down&quot, on the Coxsone label during the last weeks of 1963. By the following January it was number one in the Jamaican charts, a position it held for the next two months. The group -- Bob, Bunny and Peter together with Junior Braithwaite and two back-up singers, Beverly Kelso and Cherry Smith -- were big news.</p><p>&quotSimmer Down&quot caused a sensation in Jamaica and The Wailing Wailers began recording regularly for Coxsone Dodd&#39s Studio One Company. The groups&#39 music also found new themes, identifying with the Rude Boy street rebels in the Kingston slums. Jamaican music had found a tough, urban stance.</p><p>Over the next few years The Wailing Wailers put out some thirty sides that properly established the group.</p><p>Despite their popularity, the economics of keeping the group together proved too much and the three other members -- Junior Braithwaite, Beverly Kelso and Cherry Smith -- quit. Bob&#39s mother, Cedella, had remarried and moved to Delaware in the United States where she had saved sufficient money to send her son an air ticket. The intention was for Bob to start a new life. But before he moved to America, Bob met a young girl called Rita Anderson and, on February 10, 1966, they were married.</p><p>Marley&#39s stay in America was short-lived. He worked just enough to finance his real ambition: music. In October 1966 Bob Marley, after eight months in America, returned to Jamaica. It was a formative period in his life. The Emperor Haile Selassie had made a state visit to Jamaica in April that year. By the time Bob re-settled in Kingston the Rastafarian movement had gained new credence.</p><p>Marley was increasingly drawn towards Rastafari. In 1967 Bob&#39s music reflected his new beliefs. Gone were the Rude Boy anthems in their place was a growing commitment to spiritual and social issues, the cornerstone of his real legacy.</p><p>Marley joined up with Bunny and Peter to re-form the group, now known as The Wailers. Rita, too, had started a singing career, having a big hit with &quotPied Piper&quot, a cover of an English pop song. Jamaican music, however, was changing. The bouncy ska beat had been replaced by a slower, more sensual rhythm called rock steady.</p><p>The Wailers new commitment to Rastafarianism brought them into conflict with Coxsone Dodd and, determined to control their own destiny, the group formed their own record label, Wail &#39N&#39 Soul. Despite a few early successes, however, the Wailers&#39 business naivete proved too much and the label folded in late 1967.</p><p>The group survived, however, initially as songwriters for a company associated with the American singer Johnny Nash who, the following decade, was to have an international smash with Marley&#39s &quotStir It Up&quot. The Wailers also met up with Lee Perry, whose production genius had transformed recording studio techniques into an art form.</p><p>The Perry/Wailers combination resulted in some of the finest music the band ever made. Such tracks as &quotSoul Rebel&quot, &quotDuppy Conqueror&quot, &quot400 Years&quot and &quotSmall Axe&quot were not only classics, but they defined the future direction of reggae.</p><p>In 1970 Aston &#39Family Man&#39 Barrett and his brother Carlton (bass and drums respectively) joined the Wailers. They had been the rhythm nucleus of Perry&#39s studio band, working with the Wailers on those ground-breaking sessions. They were also unchallenged as Jamaica&#39s hardest rhythm section, a status that was to remain undiminished during the following decade. The band&#39s reputation was, at the start of the Seventies, an extraordinary one throughout the Caribbean. But internationally the Wailers were still unknown.</p><p>In the summer of 1971 Bob accepted an invitation from Johnny Nash to accompany him to Sweden where the American singer had taken a filmscore commission. While in Europe Bob secured a recording contract with CBS which was also, of course, Nash&#39s company. By the spring of 1972 the entire Wailers were in London, ostensibly promoting their CBS single &quotReggae on Broadway&quot. Instead they found themselves stranded in Britain.</p><p>As a last throw of the dice Bob Marley walked into the Basing Street Studios of Island Records and asked to see its founder Chris Blackwell. The company, of course, had been one of the prime movers behind the rise of Jamaican music in Britain indeed Blackwell had launched Island in Jamaica during the late fifties.</p><p>By 1962, however, Blackwell had realised that, by re-locating Island to London, he could represent all his Jamaican rivals in Britain. The company was re-born in May, 1962, selling initially to Britain&#39s Jamaican population centered mostly in London and Birmingham.</p><p>The hot ska rhythm, however, quickly became established as a burgeoning dance floor beat with the then growing Mod culture and, in 1964, Blackwell produced a worldwide smash with &#39My Boy Lollipop&#39, a pop/ska tune by the young Jamaican singer Millie.</p><p>Through the Sixties Island had grown to become a major source of Jamaican music, from ska and rock steady to reggae. The company had also embraced white rock music, with such bands and artists as Traffic, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Cat Stevens, Free and Fairport Convention so, when Bob Marley made his first moves with Island in 1971, he was connecting with the hottest independent in the world at that time.</p><p>Blackwell knew of Marley&#39s Jamaican reputation. The group was offered a deal unique in Jamaican terms. The Wailers were advanced &#1634000 to make an album and, for the first time, a reggae band had access to the best recording facilities and were treated in much the same way as, say, their rock group contemporaries. Before this deal, it was considered that reggae sold only on singles and cheap compilation albums. The Wailers&#39 first album &quotCatch A Fire&quot broke all the rules: it was beautifully packaged and heavily promoted. It was the start of a long climb to international fame and recognition.</p><p>Years later the acclaimed reggae dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson, commenting on &quotCatch A Fire&quot, wrote: &quotA whole new style of Jamaican music has come into being. It has a different character, a different sound. . . what I can only describe as International Reggae. It incorporates elements from popular music internationally: rock and soul, blues and funk. These elements facilitated a breakthrough on the international market.&quot</p><p>Although &quotCatch A Fire&quot was not an immediate hit, it made a considerable impact on the media. Marley&#39s hard dance rhythms, allied to his militant lyrical stance, came in complete contrast to the excesses of mainstream rock. Island also decided The Wailers should tour both Britain and America again a complete novelty for a reggae band.</p><p>Marley and the band came to London in April 1973, embarking on a club tour which hardened The Wailers as a live group. After three months, however, the band returned to Jamaica and Bunny, disenchanted by life on the road, refused to play the American tour. His place was taken by Joe Higgs, The Wailers&#39 original singing teacher.</p><p>The American tour drew packed houses and even included a weekend engagement playing support to the young Bruce Springsteen. Such was the demand that an autumn tour was also arranged with seventeen dates as support to Sly &amp The Family Stone, then the number one band in black American music.</p><p>Four shows into the tour, however, The Wailers were taken off the bill. It seems they had been too good support bands should not detract from the main attraction. The Wailers nevertheless made their way to San Francisco where they broadcast a live concert for the pioneering rock radio station, KSAN.</p><p>The bulk of that session was finally made available in February 1991, when Island released the commemorative album, &quotTalkin&#39 Blues&quot.</p><p>In 1973 The Wailers also released their second Island album, &quotBurnin&#39&quot, an LP that included new versions of some of the band&#39s older songs: &quotDuppy Conqueror&quot, for instance, &quotSmall Axe&quot and &quotPut It On&quot -- together with such tracks as &quotGet Up Stand Up&quot and &quotI Shot The Sheriff&quot. The latter, of course, was a massive worldwide hit for Eric Clapton the following year, even reaching number one in the U.S. singles&#39 chart.</p><p>In 1974 Marley spent much time of his time in the studio working on the sessions that eventually provided &quotNatty Dread&quot, an album that included such fiercely committed songs as &quotTalkin&#39 Blues&quot, &quotNo Woman No Cry&quot, &quotSo Jah Seh&quot, &quotRevolution&quot, &quotThem Belly Full (But We Hungry)&quot and &quotRebel Music (3 o&#39clock Roadblock)&quot. By the start of the next year, however, Bunny and Peter had quit the group they were later to embark on solo careers (as Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh) while the band was re-named Bob Marley &amp The Wailers.</p><p>&quotNatty Dread&quot was released in February 1975 and, by the summer, the band was on the road again. Bunny and Peter&#39s missing harmonies were replaced by the I-Threes, the female trio comprising Bob&#39s wife Rita together with Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt. Among the concerts were two shows at the Lyceum Ballroom in London which, even now, are remembered as highlights of the decade.</p><p>The shows were recorded and the subsequent live album, together with the single &quotNo Woman No Cry&quot, both made the charts. Bob Marley &amp The Wailers were taking reggae into the mainstream. By November, when The Wailers returned to Jamaica to play a benefit concert with Stevie Wonder, they were obviously the country&#39s greatest superstars.</p><p>&quotRastaman Vibration&quot, the follow-up album in 1976, cracked the American charts. It was, for many, the clearest exposition yet of Marley&#39s music and beliefs, including such tracks as &quotCrazy Baldhead&quot, &quotJohnny Was&quot, &quotWho the Cap Fit&quot and, perhaps most significantly of all, &quotWar&quot, the lyrics of which were taken from a speech by Emperor Haile Selassie.</p><p>Its international success cemented Marley&#39s growing political importance in Jamaica, where his firm Rastafarian stance had found a strong resonance with the ghetto youth.</p><p>By way of thanking the people of Jamaica, Marley decided on a free concert, to be held at Kingston&#39s National Heroes Park on December 5, 1976. The idea was to emphasise the need for peace in the slums of the city, where warring factions had brought turmoil and murder.</p><p>Just after the concert was announced, the government called an election for December 20. The campaign was a signal for renewed ghetto war and, on the eve of the concert, gunmen broke into Marley&#39s house and shot him.</p><p>In the confusion the would-be assassins only wounded Marley, who was hastily taken to a safe haven in the hills surrounding Kingston. For a day he deliberated playing the concert and then, on December 5, he came on stage and played a brief set in defiance of the gunmen.</p><p>It was to be Marley&#39s last appearance in Jamaica for nearly eighteen months. Immediately after the show he left the country and, during early 1977, lived in London where he recorded his next album, Exodus.</p><p>Released in the summer of that year, Exodus properly established the band&#39s international status. The album remained on the UK charts for 56 straight weeks, and its three singles - &quotExodus&quot, &quotWaiting in Vain&quot and &quotJammin&quot - were all massive sellers. The band also played a week of concerts at London&#39s Rainbow Theatre their last dates in the city during the seventies.</p><p>In 1978 the band capitalised on their chart success with &quotKaya&quot, an album which hit number four in the UK the week after release. That album saw Marley in a different mood a collection of love songs and, of course, homages to the power of ganja. The album also provided two chart singles, &quotSatisfy My Soul&quot and the beautiful &quotIs This Love&quot.</p><p>There were three more events in 1978, all of which were of extraordinary significance to Marley. In April, he returned to Jamaica to play the One Love Peace Concert in front of the Prime Minister Michael Manley and the Leader of the Opposition Edward Seaga.</p><p>He was then invited to the United Nations in New York to receive the organisation&#39s Medal of Peace. At the end of the year Bob also visited Africa for the first time, going initially to Kenya and then on to Ethiopia, spiritual home of Rastafari.</p><p>The band had earlier toured Europe and America, a series of shows that provided a second live album, &quotBabylon By Bus&quot. The Wailers also broke new ground by playing in Australia, Japan and New Zealand: truly international style reggae.</p><p>&quotSurvival&quot, Bob Marley&#39s ninth album for Island Records, was released in the summer of 1979. It included &quotZimbabwe&quot, a stirring anthem for the soon-to-be liberated Rhodesia, together with &quotSo Much Trouble In The World&quot, &quotAmbush In The Night&quot and &quotAfrica Unite&quot as the sleeve design, comprising the flags of the independent nations, indicated, &quotSurvival&quot was an album of pan-African solidarity.</p><p>At the start of the following year -- a new decade -- Bob Marley &amp The Wailers flew to Gabon where they were to make their African debut. It was not an auspicious occasion, however, when the band discovered they were playing in front of the country&#39s young elite. The group, nevertheless, was to make a quick return to Africa, this time at the official invitation to the government of liberated Zimbabwe to play at the country&#39s Independence Ceremony in April, 1980. It was the greatest honour ever afforded the band, and one which underlined the Wailer&#39s importance in the Third World.</p><p>The band&#39s next album, &quotUprising&quot, was released in May 1980. It was an instant hit, with the single, &quotCould You Be Loved&quot a massive worldwide seller. Uprising also featured &quotComing In From the Cold&quot, &quotWork&quot and the extraordinary closing track, &quotRedemption Song&quot.</p><p>The Wailers embarked on a major European tour, breaking festival records throughout the continent. The schedule included a 100,000-capacity crowd in Milan, the biggest show in the band&#39s history. Bob Marley &amp The Wailers, quite simply, were the most important band on the road that year and the new Uprising album hit every chart in Europe. It was a period of maximum optimism and plans were being made for an American tour, in company with Stevie Wonder, that winter.</p><p>At the end of the European tour Marley and the band went to America. Bob played two shows at Madison Square Garden but, immediately afterwards, was taken seriously ill.</p><p>Three years earlier, in London, Bob hurt a toe while playing football. The wound had become cancerous and was belatedly treated in Miami, yet it continued to fester. By 1980 the cancer, in its most virulent form, had begun to spread through Marley&#39s body.</p><p>He fought the disease for eight months, taking treatment at the clinic of Dr. Joseph Issels in Bavaria. Issels&#39 treatment was controversial and non-toxic and, for a time anyway, Bob&#39s condition seemed to stabilise.</p><p>Eventually, however, the battle proved too much. At the start of May, Bob Marley left Germany for his Jamaican home, a journey he did not complete.</p><p>He died in a Miami hospital on Monday May 11, 1981.</p><p>The previous month, Marley had been awarded Jamaica&#39s Order Of Merit, the nation&#39s third highest honour, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the country&#39s culture.</p><p>On Thursday May 21, 1981, the Hon. Robert Nesta Marley O.M. was given an official funeral by the people of Jamaica. Following the service - attended by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition - Marley&#39s body was taken to his birthplace at Nine Mile, on the north of the island, where it now rests in a mausoleum. Bob Marley was 36-years-old. His legend, however, has conquered the years.</p>', 1976, NULL),

Hailing from the depths of Wales&rsquo; Rhymney Valley, the band will soon start work on their debut album with <strong>Skindred</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>Benji Webbe</strong> for an early 2011 release. <br /><br><p>For a vote of confidence in the band&rsquo;s bright future, look no further than <strong>Monte Conner</strong>,  Roadrunner&rsquo;s Senior VP A&ampR. Conner enthuses, &quot;Revoker are one of  the most ass-kicking unsigned bands I have heard in a long time and I am  beyond proud to welcome them to the Roadrunner family. Believe it or  not, in my entire career at Roadrunner, they are the first UK band I  have signed.&quot;</p><br><br /><br><p>Although <strong>Revoker</strong> officially formed in Spring 2006, frontman/guitarist <strong>Jamie Mathias</strong> and guitarist <strong>Chris Green </strong>have been playing in bands together since they became teenagers. The band&rsquo;s engaging 19-year old mouthpiece <strong>Mathias </strong>comments,  &quot;Getting signed to Roadrunner is amazing and almost surreal. I&rsquo;ve grown  up listening to bands like Megadeth, Slipknot and Machine Head. So to  be a part of the same label as them is nuts! I think Roadrunner is the  perfect home for Revoker!&quot;</p><br><br /><br><p><strong>Green </strong>echoes his thoughts: &quot;It&rsquo;s mind-blowing!

(57, 'Believer', 'Formed in the late 80&#39s by vocalist/songwriter Kurt Bachman, the thrash outfit Believer set out to create music that inspired listeners beyond the passe topics of the bands that preceded them.     Based out of Colebrook, PA, the band&#39s aggressive vision took little time to place in motion.  After several years of touring, a self financed demo caught the interest of the Nashville based R.E.X. Music.  After little deliberation, a record contract was signed and the band headed off to record their debut <em>Extraction from Mortality</em>.  Released in 1989, this album was embraced by the press and underground metal scene alike.    With momentum rapidly gaining, they returned to the studio the next year with their sophomore effort <em>Sanity Obscure</em>.  With the replacement of their bass player, and even more label interest, the band began to develop their own signature sound, setting them high above the endless number of derivative thrash bands of the time.  A mix of symphonic elements and the most technical of  progressive tendencies, Believer followed strong with numerous U.S. dates, and co-headlined a European tour with Bolt Thrower.  <em>Sanity Obscure</em> grabbed the attention of powerhouse metal label R.C. Records (now Roadrunner), and was released along with R.E.X., giving the band greater distribution power than they&#39d ever seen.  The band continually gained momentum, and in 1993 released what later became their final effort, the legendary <em>Dimensions</em>.  The complexity of the songwriting had reached new heights as their technical precision clawed at the heels of metal&#39s finest.  Including &quotThe Trilogy of Knowledge,&quot this album took their classical flirtations to full realization in a beautiful yet brutal three movement piece.     Shortly after the release the band was put on an indefinite hiatus.  They never have reformed, but the legacy left by their short career is still held in the highest regard throughout the metal scene.  Biography by Matthew Mustain ', 0000, NULL),

(95, 'Junkie XL', '<b>JUNKIE XL : RADIO JXL</b><br><br><u>A Broadcast From The Computer Hell Cabin</u><br><br>Remixer of Elvis Presley&rsquo;s worldwide smash, A Little Less Conversation <br><br>World-renowned underground artist and co-producer on Sasha&rsquo;s Airdrawndagger<br><br>Movie soundtracks including Blade, Driven and Resident Evil<br><br>Music for Nike TV commercials and best-selling video games <br><br>Producer for bands including Sepultura, Fear Factory and Dog Eat Dog <br><br>You are locked onto Radio JXL. Don&rsquo;t touch that dial…<br><br>For Junkie XL read Xpander of Limits. A master alchemist, electronic daredevil and breaker of sound barriers, Junkie XL is the rogue scientist who electrified &rsquo;The King&rsquo; and made him quiver lip and gyrate hip beyond the grave. He&rsquo;s a shapeshifter a hybrid-engineer able to meld the visceral throb of house with the stadia-razing rumble of rock, blowing open the space within the grooves and creating new dimensions in sound. <br><br>Best known for his remix of Elvis&rsquo; A Little Less Conversation which shot to number one in 24 countries, Tom Holkenburg&rsquo;s career spans much further. Born in The Netherlands in 1967, Tom learnt piano, drums and bass at an early age before getting switched-on to synths and joining the Dutch New Wave group, Weekend At Waikiki, as multi-instrumentalist and producer, going on to form industrial rock band Nerve with vocalist Phil Mills, yielding two LPs before splitting in 1995. Meanwhile, Tom had began fervent work as a freelance producer, earning credits for bands including Sepultura, Fear Factory and Dog Eat Dog as well as major video games, movies and TV commercials. <br><br>But his obsessive work ethic drove him to drink and dangerously poor health, and he was diagnosed with a serious heart condition aged 27. Once recovered, Junkie XL was born and 1997 saw the release of the album, Saturday Night Teenage Kick. &quot;I called myself Junkie XL from the point of view that once you&rsquo;re completely overworked you never want to go there again,&quot; he explains. &quot;The &rsquo;XL&rsquo; stands for &rsquo;(E)xpanding Limits&rsquo; broadening up your vision.&quot; Tom shot to stateside fame with his rock-slanted breakbeat angst on tracks such as Billy Club, joining The Prodigy on tour in Germany with a full band. Second album Big Sounds of the Drags expanded into psychedelia, while the huge club track, Future In Computer Hell, made a fan of British DJ, Sasha, which resulting in Tom&rsquo;s collaboration on his Airdrawndagger album. A previous working relationship with Nike then saw Tom produce the music to their soccer World Cup ad – a remix of a certain deceased singer – that changed his world forever. Now it&rsquo;s time for Junkie XL to reinvent himself once more.<br><br>Radio JXL: A Broadcast From the Computerhell Cabin is the staggering new album from Junkie XL. But that&rsquo;s not all. A concept born of the digital age, it also witnesses Tom&rsquo;s radical interweaving of audio and cyberspace, simultaneously creating a double album and a virtual radio station broadcasting from www.radiojxl.com, Tom&rsquo;s brand new, fully interactive website. Not only is this where Tom&rsquo;s musical vision takes full shape but also where a vital interface takes place between Junkie XL, a cast of illustrious collaborators and you, the user. The first transmission is this: Junkie XL&rsquo;s outstanding third solo long-player, a double CD representing two typical transmissions from the not-so-typical Radio JXL. It&rsquo;s an electrified sonic soup with ingredients gathered from the corners of the Earth and fused together in Tom&rsquo;s Amsterdam HQ – known, for obvious reasons, as the &rsquo;Computerhell Cabin&rsquo;.<br><br>Entitled 3pm, the first CD simulates Junkie XL&rsquo;s ultimate daytime radio experience. From the frequency-mashing intro sequence through to its closing digital breakdown, Tom has invited some of his greatest musical heroes to join him on airwaves, including Public Enemy&rsquo;s Chuck D, synth-pop giant Gary Numan, ex-Special, Terry Hall, Depeche Mode&rsquo;s iconic front-man Dave Gahan, The Cure&rsquo;s Robert Smith, soul legend Solomon Burke, Republica&rsquo;s Saffron, Grant Nicholas of Feeder, Dutch superstar Anouk, Aussie electronicists Infusion and the late, great reggae icon Peter Tosh. A multi-instrumentalist as well as a studio wizard, Tom has also played all the instruments himself, including guitar, piano and live drums.<br><br>The second CD, 3am, looks to Junkie XL&rsquo;s nocturnal persona a slow-building odyssey that demonstrates the production capabilities that have propelled Tom to the forefront of the electronic dance scene. From the liquid cool ambience of Chilled and the spatial, digitised dub of Dubzilla, the journey moves through Casio&rsquo;s stripped-down beats before picking up pace with the 12&quot; mix of Angels and the anthemic, guitar-led Breezer, Tom&rsquo;s collaboration with the world&rsquo;s most sought-after DJ, Sasha. The floor-rocking Nudge drives into progressive dance territory whilst Red mounts an acid-powered assault on the senses before the 12&quot; mix of Beauty Never Fades introduces Saffron&rsquo;s unmistakable vocals. Cosmic Cure brings an acoustically-tinged, melancholy edge before the CD closes with the grand, beatless strains of Rehsurc.<br><br>Introducing the guests…<br><br>SAFFRON Crusher, Spirits, Beauty Never Fades<br><br>A spiky presence on the Britpop scene as Republica&rsquo;s scarlet-fringed lead singer, Saffron&rsquo;s unmistakable voice retains a barely restrained punk attitude. With three self-penned contributions, she&rsquo;s also the most conspicuous vocal presence on Radio JXL. Incendiary opener, Crusher, sees the fiery rock vixen ready to go over a bombardment of electrified breakbeats, Spirits ruffs things up a bit in hooligan reggae mode, whilst the club hit, Beauty Never Fades, features her dark incantations in a subtle balance of darkness, drama and grace.<br><br>PETER TOSH Don&rsquo;t Wake Up Policeman<br><br>Though tragically murdered in 1987, Peter Tosh remains one of the most powerful voices in reggae history. Sleepy Policeman originated from an (incredibly) unreleased session with Sly & Robbie and The Wailers&rsquo; backing singers which may never have seen the light of day were it not for Junkie XL&rsquo;s intervention. &quot;A friend of mine did a recording in the seventies in Jamaica,&quot; explains Tom. &quot;He said, &rsquo;You might have a look in my studio, I still have like six multi-track tapes with Peter Tosh, Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare. I thought, &rsquo;You must be kidding&rsquo;… I really wanted to create this really summery, groovy track and in the end it turned out so naturally. It almost seems like he actually sung on that track.&quot;<br><br>GARY NUMAN Angels<br><br>Electro-pop innovator reinvented as rock god, Gary Numan is an undisputed legend with a fanatical following that includes Junkie XL himself. &quot;Buying Are Friends Electric in &rsquo;78 changed my life,&quot; gushes Tom. &quot;Working with him and having him in the studio with such an overwhelming experience. I mean it&rsquo;s like, &rsquo;Fuck, Gary Numan!&rsquo;&quot; Angels, Numan admitted, was his finest vocal performance in years. His unmistakable tones couple wonderfully with a throbbing electronic undertow, gothic atmospherics and dark, shrouded melodies. <br><br>DAVE GAHAN Reload<br><br>The frontman of synth pioneers and stadium rock conquerors, Depeche Mode, Dave Gahan is another of Tom&rsquo;s heroes to collaborate on what he admits has become &quot;a wish-list come true&quot;. Reload was initially intended for the soundtrack to the Matrix sequel, Matrix Reloaded, but by a twist of fate found its way onto Tom&rsquo;s own album. &quot;It&rsquo;s a track that Dave normally wouldn&rsquo;t sing on and I think that&rsquo;s the beauty of it,&quot; he says. &quot;It&rsquo;s a very funky track with a really funky guitar line and in the chorus it really explodes. His voice gives it kind of dark atmosphere and at the same time it&rsquo;s uplifting as well… Depeche Mode were so important for my perception of what electronic music could be in pop music.&quot; <br><br>ROBERT SMITH Perfect Blue Sky<br><br>Known to millions as the wild-haired, lipstick-smeared lead singer of The Cure, Robert Smith&rsquo;s exquisite vocals match Tom&rsquo;s sublime New Wave-style production to perfection on one of the album&rsquo;s most beautiful tracks. Tom explains: &quot;It&rsquo;s an electro track and it has a really moody vibe to it. It was so funny, I played it to ten different people and they were all like, &rsquo;Jesus, you should have Robert Smith to sing on this&rsquo;, and well, this track was intended for Robert. It feels like such a pretty love-song – that&rsquo;s how it turned out, in a Robert Smith way. His voice is so incredible – as soon as he starts singing there&rsquo;s no way you could mix his voice up with anyone else. It&rsquo;s like, &rsquo;Jesus, Robert Smith is doing a vocal on this track!&rsquo;&quot;<br><br>CHUCK D Access To The Excess<br><br>A hip-hop pioneer and political firebrand described by Spike Lee as &quot;One of the most politically and socially conscious artists of any generation&quot;, Chuck D is nothing if not inspirational. Access To The Excess finds the Public Enemy frontman continuing to bring the noise and telling the world what time it is. Chuck delivers a tough critique of contemporary hip-hop&rsquo;s cultural vacancy – an insistent call to action over digitised, dub-heavy beats from the Computerhell laboratory. <br><br>SOLOMON BURKE Catch Up To My Step<br><br>&quot;One of the four or five people in America that actually invented soul music,&quot; according to Tom, living legend Solomon Burke is the self-proclaimed &rsquo;King of Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; Soul&rsquo;, a man mountain and an evergreen r&b colossus who continues to throw down the gauntlet to all pretenders. Catch Up To My Step is a track bubbling over with full-blooded blues licks and hard-rocking beats combining with Burke&rsquo;s larger-than-life vocal presence, proving why he&rsquo;s still a formidable force to be reckoned with.<br><br>TERRY HALL Never Alone<br><br>The original 2 Tone hero returns to his ska roots for the first time since his all-conquering heyday with The Specials. Never Alone is a skanking roller-coaster of a tune destined for dancefloor rudeness and bearing close relation to one of Terry&rsquo;s finest moments. &quot;With Terry, I thought it would be a great mix to do something with dance music but also have that ska vibe,&quot; says Tom. &quot;The first time he listened to the track he really had to prevent himself singing (The Specials&rsquo;) Gangsters. Then he came to Amsterdam and started singing and was like, &rsquo;Damn I did it again!&rsquo;&quot;<br><br>INFUSION Nightmares, Aqua Man<br><br>Australian dance sensation, Infusion, contribute two tracks to the Radio JXL playlist. The Sydney-based trio of Manuel Sharrad, Frank Xavier and Jamie Stevens shot to international acclaim with their debut album Phrases and Numbers. It was after Junkie XL&rsquo;s stunning remix of the group&rsquo;s Legacy single that they embarked on this further collaboration. Nightmares is a thrilling electronic joyride, an expert meld of energy-driven dance dynamics and melodic sensibility. Aqua Man moves into more plaintive waters, fusing downtempo and acoustic elements around daydreamy superhero fantasies.<br><br>ANOUK Between These Walls<br><br>Dutch singer Anouk is renowned for her uncompromising approach to both her music and image. She is the Netherlands&rsquo; foremost rock personality, a singer of heartfelt honesty and guts. On Between These Walls, her powerful cadences tighten their emotional grip around a sparse, downtempo track. It&rsquo;s emotive pop with an imploring message.<br><br>PHIL MILLS Logos<br><br>For Logos, Tom hooked up with his former partner in the influential Dutch industrial band, Nerve. English-born Phil Mills brings his considerable talents to one of the album&rsquo;s tenderest moments, his vocodered vocal tripping gently over a heavy, dubwise bassline and rich, melancholic chords.<br><br>SHELLEY HARLAND Rivers<br><br>English-born, New York-based vocalist Shelley Harland has a proven reputation within the dance music scene, with guest vocals on huge club tracks for the likes of Joshua Ryan and Pole Folder as well as her own forthcoming album. She&rsquo;s also an artist of emotional sensitivity and depth, as she displays here on Rivers, a beautiful, near-beatless mix of glacial ambience and stirring, ethereal vocals.<br><br>GRANT NICHOLAS Broken<br><br>Lead singer with world-conquering rock band, Feeder, Grant Nicholas has a fine pedigree for inspiring, emotive song writing. With the 3pm CD&rsquo;s closing track, Broken, Grant displays himself in a different, more thoughtful light to the stadium-scale rock of his band, delivering a tender vocal over another melodic, heart-rending track with a strong emotional undertow.<br><br>SASHA Breezer<br><br>One of the most sought-after DJs in the world over the last decade, the man also know as Alexander Coe finally released his long-awaited debut artist album, Airdrawndagger, in 2002 to widespread acclaim. It was not without a little help from Junkie XL, whom Sasha had struck up a relationship with after picking up on Tom&rsquo;s Future In Computer Hell single in the late nineties. Breezer is a sure-fire crowd-pleaser with peak upon peak of sun-showering bliss.<br><br>But this is just the beginning. There will also be a third, &rsquo;hidden&rsquo; transmission located on the website, especially for those twenty-four hour people who just don&rsquo;t want to go to bed. And Radio JXL is also going live, with broadcasts on location from some of the world&rsquo;s largest festivals.<br><br>Radio JXL is ready to go on air. What are you waiting for?

Rather, Rumblefish is an organic, unique and unexpected experience. “We&rsquo;re such different personalities,” begins singer Mike Ryan. “You would never expect us to get along in a room to record. But when we write music, it&rsquo;s like a connection within the soul, it goes beyond any conscious thing.”  The music that these four Los Angelenos create is an aural and emotional experience that draws liberally from all over the Rock map, but ultimately is deftly harnessed on <u>Exit Highland</u>, Rumblefish&rsquo;s debut CD for Roadrunner Records. Produced by Mudrock (Godsmack, Powerman 5000) and mixed by Andy Wallace (Nirvana, The Vines) and Jay Baumgardner (Papa Roach, Hoobastank) <u>Exit Highland</u> is a collection of songs that are as heady as they are heavy. <br><br>Solidifying their current lineup in early 2002, drummer Possum hooked up first with lead singer Ryan.  The two were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist DeCosta – who, like Ryan, was already firmly entrenched in the L.A. scene.  Bassist Dungis completed the equation – his calm demeanor the perfect ying to the band&rsquo;s musical yang.  The band was shunned by everyone initially until they struck a demo deal with Roadrunner and recorded what was to become their first single, the infectiously catchy and intense “In My Head.”  From there, the band built upon a musical foundation that was simple and unmeditated.  “We have a little metal element, a little rock, but not too much of one thing, it&rsquo;s our own sound.  We&rsquo;re not trying to reinvent the wheel - We do hard, alternative music but with melodies and a simple, memorable vibe,&quot; explains DeCosta. It&rsquo;s easy to understand their “kitchen sink” mentality given their disparate backgrounds.  Ryan, a self-described “troublemaker” once played baseball for the Cleveland Indians scout  team, but music was his true muse.  “I used to be in hardcore bands – just screaming and shit. I felt comfortable in hardcore music and it took me a while to realize I could actually sing.  It finally just hit me over the head that I&rsquo;m a singer,” explains Ryan.  In DeCosta, he&rsquo;s found the perfect musical partner, thanks to his own schizophrenic musical upbringing.  “I&rsquo;ve been involved in music since I could walk and talk,” he reflects. <br><br>It&rsquo;s that eclectic background that ultimately defined Rumblefish&rsquo;s sound – part unbridled rock, part introspective soul-searching that led to them sharing the stage with such acts as <b>Linkin Park, Crazy Town, Ultraspank, Mudvayne</b> and <b>Soulfly</b>. From the barely controlled chaos of “Wasting Time” to the head-banging groove of the soaring “Far,” the band is intelligent, funny and politically and personally aware. Yet <u>Exit Highland</u>&rsquo;s songs lean decidedly toward the personal and cathartic. “I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying to get away from the wrong people, but always ended up in destructive situations,” Ryan confesses. “When I write a song, I never know what it&rsquo;s about until I&rsquo;ve finished it. The first single, “In My Head,” is about drifting, letting the seasons change my moods, watching things fall apart all the time. It&rsquo;s a beautiful disaster, and I keep walking on that thin line,” he explains.  &quot;&quot;Forget” was written when a relationship was in turmoil. I wrote the song in three minutes as I drove down the street to get away from my then-girlfriend.”  Not all are as immediate or concrete. The irresistible “Stumble and Fall” could be “about a girl. Or alcohol. Or about anything you think,” grins the fast-talking Ryan. “Wait,” another winner, is about dealing with obsessive-compulsiveness. “I call that &rsquo;wait&rsquo; the &rsquo;hiccup&rsquo; of the mind. It&rsquo;s about people hesitating, being okay one minute, then you&rsquo;re not, and you can&rsquo;t control the thoughts in your head. It&rsquo;s about being unstable.&quot;  <br><br>While Rumblefish&rsquo;s lyrics may be open to interpretation, the band has ready answers for two of their most-asked questions. Yes, Ryan is a big fan of author S.E. Hinton, who wrote the seminal teen angst book “Rumblefish.” Then, when the vocalist saw the film, “I was like, &rsquo;if I could be in a movie or make a movie, this would be it!&rsquo; It has a mystery.”  And the dark name fits his mindset and the band&rsquo;s music perfectly. As for <u>Exit Highland</u>, it refers to one of Los Angeles&rsquo; main arteries. “We all take the street to rehearsal and some of us live off it,” De Costa notes. “That&rsquo;s what we do every day—Exit Highland.”<br><br>With <u>Exit Highland</u> ready to enter the world&rsquo;s consciousness, Rumblefish are eager to bring their music to the public. “We&rsquo;ve all spent hard years trying to prove so much, to realize our potential, and with this record we feel we&rsquo;ve gone beyond that,” believes Ryan. “While making <u>Exit Highland</u> there was a lot of surreal, peaceful stuff as well as teeth-pulling, but it was an overall amazing experience and we couldn&rsquo;t be happier with how it turned out.”', 0000, NULL);

('Jamaican Ska', 'Reggae', 'Ska (pronounced /?sk??/, Jamaican [skja]) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae.[1] Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.[2][3][4][5]\r\n\r\nMusic historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s (First Wave), the English 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s (Second Wave) and the third wave ska movement, which started in the 1980s (Third Wave) and rose to popularity in the US in the 1990s.'),
('Reggae', NULL, 'Reggae is a music genre first developed in Jamaica in the late 1960s. While sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to most types of Jamaican music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that originated following on the development of ska and rocksteady.\r\n\r\nReggae is based on a rhythmic style characterized by accents on the off-beat, known as the skank. Reggae is normally slower than both ska and rocksteady.[2] Reggae usually accents the second and fourth beat in each bar, with the rhythm guitar also either emphasising the third beat or holding the chord on the second beat until the fourth is played. It is mainly this "third beat", its speed and the use of complex bass lines that differentiated reggae from rocksteady, although later styles incorporated these innovations separately.'),
('Rocksteady', 'Reggae', 'Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966.[1] A successor to ska, and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals and The Paragons. The term rocksteady comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis  song "Rock Steady". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was "Hold Me Tight" (no. 5 in UK and U.S.) with the American soul singer Johnny Nash (1968).'),
('Rap Rock', 'Rock', 'Rap rock is a cross-genre fusing vocal and instrumental elements of hip hop with various forms of rock. Rap rock is often confused with rap metal and rapcore, subgenres that include heavy metal-oriented and hardcore punk-oriented bands, respectively.'),
('Rock', NULL, 'Rock music is a genre of popular music that entered the mainstream in the 1960s. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, rhythm and blues, country music and also drew on folk music, jazz and classical music. The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, and keyboard instruments such as hammond organ, piano, or, since the late 60s, synthesizers. Rock music typically uses simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4/4 meter, with a repetitive snare drum back beat on beats two and four.[1] Guitar solos feature prominently in rock music, however keyboard, saxophone and blues-style harmonica  are also sometimes used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form", it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody."[2]\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, rock music developed different subgenres. When it was blended with folk music it created folk rock, with blues to create blues-rock and with jazz, to create jazz-rock fusion. In the 1970s, rock incorporated influences from soul, funk, and Latin music. Also in the 1970s, rock developed a number of subgenres, such as soft rock, glam rock, heavy metal, hard rock, progressive rock, and punk rock. Rock subgenres that emerged in the 1980s included new wave, hardcore punk and alternative rock. In the 1990s, rock subgenres included grunge, Britpop, indie rock, and nu metal.\r\n\r\nA group of musicians specializing in rock music is called a rock band or rock group. Many rock groups consist of an electric guitarist, lead singer, bass guitarist, and a drummer, forming a quartet. Some groups omit one or more of these roles or utilize a lead singer who plays an instrument while singing, sometimes forming a trio or duo; others include additional musicians such as one or two rhythm guitarists or a keyboardist. Rock bands from some genres, particularly those related to rock''s foundations in rock and roll, include a saxophone. More rarely, groups also utilize bowed stringed instruments such as violins or cellos, and brass instruments such as trumpets or trombones.\r\n\r\nMore recently the term rock has been used as a blanket term including forms such as pop music, reggae music, soul music, and sometimes even hip hop, with which it has often been contrasted through much of its history.'),
('Pop', NULL, 'Pop music (a term that originally derives from an abbreviation of "popular") is usually understood to be commercially recorded music, often oriented towards a youth market, usually consisting of relatively short, simple love songs utilizing technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. Pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, but as a genre is particularly associated with the rock and roll and later rock style.'),
('Soft Rock', 'Rock', 'Soft rock is a style of music which uses the techniques of rock and roll (often combined with elements from folk rock and singer-songwriter  pop) to compose a softer, more toned-down sound. Soft rock songs generally tend to focus on themes like love, everyday life and relationships. The genre tends to make heavy use of acoustic guitars, pianos, synthesizers and sometimes saxophones. The electric guitars in soft rock are normally faint and high-pitched.'),
('Power Pop', 'Pop', 'Power pop (or powerpop) is a popular musical genre that draws its inspiration from 1960s British and American pop and rock music. It typically incorporates a combination of musical devices such as strong melodies, crisp vocal harmonies, economical arrangements, and prominent guitar riffs. Instrumental solos are usually kept to a minimum, and blues elements are largely downplayed. Recordings tend to display production values that lean toward compression and a forceful drum beat. Instruments usually include one or more electric guitars, an electric bass guitar, a drum kit, and sometimes electric keyboards or synthesizers. While its cultural impact has waxed and waned over the decades, power pop is among rock''s most enduring subgenres.'),
('R&B', NULL, 'Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated to R&B, is a genre of popular African American music that originated in the 1940s.[1]  The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat" was becoming more popular.[2]\r\n\r\nThe term has subsequently had a number of shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s and beyond, the term rhythm and blues was frequently applied to blues records.[3] Starting in the 1950s, after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term "R&B" became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. By the 1970s, rhythm and blues was used as a blanket term for soul and funk. In the 1980s, a newer style of R&B developed, becoming known as contemporary R&B.'),
('NewJack', 'R&B', 'New jack swing or swingbeat[1] is a fusion genre popular from the late-1980s into the mid-1990s. It fuses the rhythms, samples and production techniques of hip-hop and dance-pop with the urban contemporary sound of R&B. The new jack swing style developed as many previous R&B styles did, by combining elements of older styles with newer trends. It uses R&B style vocals sung over hip hop and dance-pop style influenced instrumentation. The sound of new jack swing comes from the hip hop "swing" beats created by drum machine, and hardware samplers, which was popular during the golden age of hip hop, with contemporary R&B style singing.\r\n\r\nThe term "new jack swing" was coined by writer-filmmaker Barry Michael Cooper (screenwriter for the films New Jack City, Above the Rim, and Sugar Hill) in a cover story in the Village Voice titled, "Teddy Riley Groove Master: Harlem Gangsters Raise a Genius", dated October 18, 1988. Merriam-Webster''s online dictionary defines new jack swing as "pop music usually performed by black musicians that combines elements of jazz, funk, rap, and rhythm and blues[2] Encyclopædia Britannica calls it the "most pop-oriented rhythm-and-blues music since 1960s Motown", since its "performers were unabashed entertainers, free of artistic pretensions; its songwriters and producers were commercial professionals." New jack swing did not take up the trend of using sampled beats, and instead created beats using the then-new SP-1200 and Roland 808 drum machines to lay an "insistent beat under light melody lines and clearly enunciated vocals."[1] Encyclopædia Britannica states that the "key producers" were Babyface and Teddy Riley.'),
('NeoSoul', 'R&B', 'Neo soul is a term coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B.[1] Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart,[1][2] with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music.\r\n\r\nDeveloped in the United States and United Kingdom during the 1980s and early 1990s as a soul "revival" movement,[2][3] neo soul emerged into the mainstream with the commercial and critical breakthroughs of several neo soul artists during the 1990s, as it was marketed as an alternative to the producer-driven, digitally-approached R&B of the time.[4] Since its initial mainstream popularity and impact on the sound of contemporary R&B, it has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both American and international artists.[5] According to Mark Anthony Neal, "neo-soul and its various incarnations has helped to redefine the boundaries and contours of black pop".'),
('Funk', 'R&B', 'Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid-late 1960s when African American musicians blended soul music, soul jazz and R&B into a rhythmic, danceable new form of music. Funk de-emphasizes melody and harmony and brings a strong rhythmic groove of electric bass and drums to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing it from R&B and soul songs centered around chord progressions.\r\n\r\nLike much African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, Hammond organ, and drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones, trumpets, and in some cases, a trombone, which plays rhythmic "hits".\r\n\r\nMany of the most famous bands in the genre also played disco and soul extensively. Funk music was a major influence on the development of disco music and afrobeat, and funk samples have been used extensively in genres including hip hop, house music and drum and bass. It is also the main influence of go-go.'),
('Southern Rock', 'Rock', 'Southern rock is a subgenre of rock music, and genre of Americana. It developed in the Southern United States from rock and roll, country music, and blues, and is focused generally on electric guitar and vocals. Although no one really knows where the term southern rock came from, "many people feel that these important contributors to the development of rock and roll have been minimized in rock’s history.'),
('Classic Rock', 'Rock', 'Classic rock was originally conceived as a radio station programming format which developed from the album-oriented rock  (AOR) format in the early 1980s. The first station to broadcast the format fulltime, and the first station to use the term "Classic Rock" on the air was KRBE-AM, Houston, in 1983. Program Director Paul Christy designed the format to play only early album rock, from the 60s and early 70s, without any current music or Top 40 material.[1] In the United States, this rock music format now features a large playlist  of songs ranging from the 1960s and 1970s. The traditional classic rock genre usually ends in the early 1980s, with mid-80s additions from the hair metal genre only recently being considered "classic rock." Some stations continue to include a limited number of current releases.[2]\r\n\r\nThe classic rock stations re-create the sound of album oriented rock stations of the 60s-80s (although usually with a much more limited playlist) and appeal mainly to adults, rather than teenagers (despite this, many classic rock acts consistently attract new generations of fans).[3][2] Some classic-rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station''s sound, or from established classic rock artists that are still producing new albums.[2]\r\n\r\nClassic rock in recent years has been expanded to include glam metal and progressive rock acts. These artists are often put on "late classic rock" stations (such as XM Classic Rewind) while the more traditional artists are put on "early classic rock" stations (such as XM Classic Vinyl).[4] Even "late classic rock" stations, for the most part, have avoided playing 1990s rock such as early alternative rock and grunge because of the dramatic change in the tone of rock music during that time frame (Music Choice''s "Retro Rock" is a notable exception to this).\r\n\r\nA format that plays both classic rock and more current and modern selections is known as active rock. Many songs in the traditional classic rock genre have since been incorporated, along with songs in the later portion of the traditional "oldies" genre, into the fairly new format of classic hits.'),
('Psychedelic Rock', 'Rock', 'Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs. It emerged during the mid 1960s among folk rock and blues-rock bands in United States and the United Kingdom. It often used new recording techniques and effects and drew on non-Western sources such the ragas and drones of Indian music. Psychedelic rock bridged the transition from early blues- and folk music-based rock to progressive rock, glam rock, hard rock and as a result influenced the development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia.'),
('Glam', 'Rock', 'Glam rock (also known as glitter rock) is a style of rock and pop music  that developed in the UK in the early 1970s, which was performed by singers and musicians who wore outrageous clothes, makeup and hairstyles, particularly platform-soled boots and glitter.[1] The flamboyant costumes and visual styles of glam performers were often camp or androgynous, and have been connected with new views of gender roles. Glam rock visuals peaked during the mid 1970s with artists including T. Rex, David Bowie , Roxy Music and Gary Glitter in the UK and New York Dolls, Lou Reed and Jobriath in the US.'),
('British Invasion', 'Rock', 'The British Invasion is a term used to describe the large number of rock and roll, beat, rock and pop performers from the United Kingdom who became popular in the United States during the period from 1964 through 1966.'),
('Arena Rock', 'Rock', 'Arena rock (also referred to as stadium rock, melodic rock, anthem rock or AOR, short for adult-oriented rock) is a loosely defined term describing a generation of rock music. It was established by heavy metal, hard rock and progressive rock bands in the 1970s.[1][2] Arena rock songs feature "slick productions",[3]  an emphasis on vocal harmonies on the choruses and an "unnatural emphasis on large, anthemic hooks and choruses", the last trait "setting it apart from its influences".[1] Arena rock is sometimes pejoratively termed "corporate rock" by critics.\r\n\r\nArena rock is defined by its loud audiences in concerts. It is music performed live in stadiums and arenas. Arena rock shows often feature "smoke bombs, laser light spectaculars, large amplifiers and video screens",[4] as well as "guitar pyrotechnics".[1]'),
('Thrash', 'metal', 'Thrash metal is a subgenre of heavy metal  that is characterized usually by its fast tempo and aggression. Songs of the genre typically use fast percussive and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work.[1] Lyrics of thrash metal songs often deal with social issues using direct and denunciatory language, an approach which partially overlaps with the hardcore genre. The "Big Four" bands of thrash metal are Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer,[2] who simultaneously created and popularized the genre in the early 1980s.\r\n\r\nThe origins of thrash metal are generally traced to the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a number of bands began incorporating the sound of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal,[3] creating a new genre and developing into a separate movement from punk rock and hardcore. This genre is more aggressive compared to its relative, speed metal, and can be seen in part to be a reaction to the lighter, more widely acceptable sounds and themes of glam metal.'),
('Speed Metal', 'metal', 'Speed metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from NWOBHM and hardcore punk roots. It is described by Allmusic as "extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding" music.\r\n\r\nMotörhead is often credited as the first band to invent/play speed metal.[1] Some of speed metal''s earlier influences include Deep Purple''s "Fireball" and Queen''s "Stone Cold Crazy" (which was eventually covered by the thrash metal band Metallica), from their 1974 album Sheer Heart Attack[2], and Deep Purple''s song "Highway Star", from their album Machine Head. The latter was called ''early speed metal'' by Robb Reiner of speed metal band Anvil.[3]. Led Zeppelin''s "Communication Breakdown", first released in January 1969, could also be said to be an early template for speed metal as mentioned in Mac Randall''s [4].\r\n\r\nSpeed metal eventually evolved into thrash metal.[5] Although many tend to equate the two subgenres, there is a distinct difference between them. In his book Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal, Ian Christe states that "...thrash metal relies more on long, wrenching rhythmic breaks, while speed metal... is a cleaner and more musically intricate subcategory, still loyal to the dueling melodies of classic metal."'),
('Alternative Metal', 'metal', 'Alternative metal is a genre of heavy metal that gained popularity in the early 1990s.[1] Most notably, alternative metal bands are characterized by heavy guitar riffs; typically, these riffs have a pronounced experimental edge, including unconventional lyrics, odd time signatures, more syncopation than typical metal, unusual technique, a resistance to conventional approaches to heavy music and an incorporation of a wide range of influences outside of the metal music scene.'),
('Alternative', NULL, ''),
('Adult Alternative', 'Alternative', 'Adult contemporary music (AC) is a broad style of popular music that ranges from lush 1960s vocal music[1] to predominantly ballad-heavy music with varying degrees of rock influence.[2]\r\n\r\nAC radio plays mainstream music excluding hip hop, hard rock, youth orientated RnB, some teen pop music and rhythmic dance tracks (though since the 2000s, some of these have begun to be included), which is intended for a more adult audience. Radio stations playing this format will often target 25-54 year-olds, the group most valued by advertisers.\r\n\r\nOver the years AC has spawned several sub-genres: "hot AC", "soft AC" (also known as "lite AC"), "urban AC", "rhythmic AC", "smooth AC" (i.e., smooth jazz), and "Christian AC" (i.e., a softer type of Contemporary Christian music). Some radio stations play only hot AC; some play only soft AC; and some play both. Thus it is not usually considered a specific genre of music, since it is merely an assembly of selected tracks of musicians of many different genres.'),
('Dance Pop', 'Pop', 'Dance-pop (or dance pop) is dance-oriented pop music that developed from post-disco, beginning in the early 1980s.'),
('General Pop', 'Pop', ''),
('Gangsta Hardcore', 'Hiphop', 'Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that reflects the violent lifestyles of inner-city youths.[1] Gangsta is a non-rhotic pronunciation of the word gangster. The genre was pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as Schooly D and Ice T, and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like N.W.A.[1]  After the national attention that Ice-T and N.W.A created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop. The subject matter inherent in gangsta rap has caused a great deal of controversy. Criticism has come from both left wing and right wing commentators, and religious leaders, who have accused the genre of promoting violence, profanity, sex, homophobia, racism, promiscuity, misogyny, rape, street gangs, drive-by shootings, vandalism, thievery, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, substance abuse and materialism.\r\n\r\nSome commentators (for example, Spike Lee in his satirical film Bamboozled) have criticized it as analogous to black minstrel shows and blackface performance, in which performers – both black and white – were made up to look African American, and acted in a stereotypically uncultured and ignorant manner for the entertainment of audiences. Gangsta rappers often defend themselves by saying that they are describing the reality of inner-city life, and that they are only adopting a character, like an actor playing a role, which behaves in ways that they may not necessarily endorse.'),
('Hiphop', NULL, 'Hip hop music is a musical genre that developed as part of hip hop culture, and is defined by four key stylistic elements: rapping, DJing/scratching, sampling (or synthesis), and beatboxing. Hip hop began in the South Bronx of New York City in the 1970s. The term rap is often used synonymously with hip hop, but hip hop also denotes the practices of an entire subculture.[1]\r\n\r\nRapping, also referred to as MCing or emceeing, is a vocal style in which the artist speaks lyrically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized beat. Beats, almost always in 4/4 time signature, can be created by sampling and/or sequencing portions of other songs by a producer.[2] They also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Rappers may write, memorize, or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a cappella or to a beat.\r\n'),

('General HipHop', 'Hiphop', ''),
('Contemporary Blues', 'Blues', 'In the 1990s, blues performers explored a range of musical genres, as can be seen, for example, from the broad array of nominees of the yearly Blues Music Awards, previously named W. C. Handy Awards[121] or of the Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary and Traditional Blues Album. The Bilboard Blues Album chart  monitors and therefore provides an overview over the current blues production. Contemporary blues music is nurtured by several blues labels such as: Alligator Records, Ruf Records, Chess Records (MCA), Delmark Records, NorthernBlues Music, and Vanguard Records (Artemis Records). Some labels are famous for their rediscovering and remastering of blues rarities such as Arhoolie Records, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings (heir of Folkways Records) and Yazoo Records (Shanachie Records).[122]'),
('Blues', NULL, 'Blues is the name given to both a musical form and a music genre that originated in African-American communities of primarily the Deep South of the United States at the end of the 19th century from spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads.[1] The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll, is characterized by specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues chord progression is the most common. The blue notes that, for expressive purposes are sung or played flattened or gradually bent (minor 3rd to major 3rd) in relation to the pitch of the major scale, are also an important part of the sound.\r\n\r\nThe blues genre is based on the blues form but possesses other characteristics such as specific lyrics, bass lines and instruments. Blues can be subdivided into several subgenres ranging from country to urban blues that were more or less popular during different periods of the 20th century. Best known are the Delta, Piedmont, Jump and Chicago blues styles. World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues-rock evolved.\r\n\r\nThe term "the blues" refers to the "blue devils", meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is found in George Colman''s one-act farce Blue Devils (1798).[2] Though the use of the phrase in African-American music may be older, it has been attested to since 1912, when Hart Wand''s "Dallas Blues" became the first copyrighted blues composition.[3][4] In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood.'),
('Metalcore', 'metal', 'Metalcore is a fusion genre combining various elements of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The name of it is a portmanteau of the names of the two genres. The term took on its current meaning in the mid-1990s, describing bands such as Earth Crisis, Deadguy and Integrity.[3] The earliest of these groups, Integrity, began performing in 1988; some modern practitioners of the genre include Killswitch Engage, Underoath, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying and The Devil Wears Prada.[4] Metalcore is distinguished from other punk metal fusions by its emphasis on breakdowns:[5] slower, intense passages conducive to moshing.[6] The genre has had a saturation of bands in the last five years. Sepultura has been credited to "lay the foundation" for the genre.[7]'),
('Progressive Metal', 'metal', 'Progressive metal (sometimes known as prog metal) is a subgenre of heavy metal, which blends the powerful, guitar-driven sound of metal with the complex compositional structures, odd time signatures, and intricate instrumental playing of progressive rock. Many progressive metal bands are also influenced by jazz fusion and classical music. Like progressive rock songs, progressive metal songs are typically much longer than standard metal songs, and are often thematically linked in concept albums.'),
('Industrial Metal', 'metal', 'ndustrial metal is a heavy metal musical genre that draws from industrial music and many different types of heavy metal, using repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals.[1] Founding industrial metal acts include Ministry,[2] Godflesh,[3] and KMFDM[2]. The "one-man-band" Nine Inch Nails helped it gain a mass audience.[4]\r\n\r\nIndustrial metal''s popularity led to some criticism from other artists associated with the industrial scene. Subsequently, it is most well-known in various European permutations. Industrial metal groups have produced many acclaimed music videos.'),
('Symphonic Metal', 'metal', 'Symphonic metal is a term used to describe heavy metal music that has symphonic elements; that is, elements that are either borrowed from classical music or, as with progressive rock  music, create a style reminiscent of it, e.g. operatic female lead vocals; instrumentation that includes acoustic guitars and different types of keyboards instead of relying solely on electric guitars; asymmetrical meters such as 5/4 and 7/8, and classical thematic material in addition to characteristically heavy metal power riffs.\r\n\r\nWhen referring to bands from other genres, it refers to bands who use minor classical and operatic themes in their music similar to what one finds in the symphonic metal genre, to show they are more "symphonic" than other bands within their genre.'),
('Nu Metal', 'metal', 'Nu metal (also known as nü-metal[4] or aggro-metal[5][6]) is a subgenre[7] of heavy metal.[4][8][9][10] It is a fusion genre[9] which combines elements of heavy metal with other genres, including grunge and hip hop. The genre gained mainstream success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.'),
('Death Metal', 'metal', 'Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, blast beat drumming, minor keys or atonality, and complex song structures with multiple tempo changes.\r\n\r\nBuilding from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid 1980s.[2] Metal acts such as Slayer,[3][4] Kreator,[5] Celtic Frost,[6] and Venom were very important influences to the crafting of the genre.[2] Along with the band Death and its frontman Chuck Schuldiner, who is often referred to as "the father of death metal",[7][8][9] bands such as Possessed,[10] Obituary and Morbid Angel are often considered pioneers of the genre.[11] In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular record labels like Earache and Roadrunner began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.[12] Since then, death metal has diversified, spawning a variety of subgenres.[13]'),
('Hardrock', 'Rock', 'Hard rock (or heavy rock) is a loosely defined genre of rock music which has its earliest roots in mid-1960s garage rock, blues rock and psychedelic rock. It is typified by a heavy use of distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos, and keyboards.\r\n\r\nHard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, AC/DC and Van Halen, and reached a commercial peak in the mid 1980s. The glam metal of bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N'' Roses followed up with great success in the later part of that decade, before losing popularity in the face of grunge. Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and in the 2000s there came a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post punk revival.'),
('Gothic Metal', 'metal', 'Gothic metal or goth metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that combines the aggression of doom metal with the dark melancholy of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of doom/death, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally melodramatic and mournful with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences.\r\n\r\nPioneers of gothic metal include Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema, all from the north of England. Other pioneers from the first half of the 1990s include Type O Negative from the United States, Tiamat from Sweden, and The Gathering from the Netherlands. Norwegian band Theatre of Tragedy developed the "beauty and the beast" aesthetic of combining aggressive male vocals with clean female vocals, a contrast that has since been adopted by many gothic metal groups. During the mid-1990s, Moonspell, Theatres des Vampires and Cradle of Filth brought the gothic approach to black metal. By the end of the decade, a symphonic metal variant of gothic metal had been developed by Tristania and Within Temptation.\r\n\r\nIn the 21st century, gothic metal has moved towards the mainstream in Europe, particularly in Finland where groups such as The 69 Eyes, Entwine, HIM, Lullacry, Poisonblack and Sentenced have released hit singles or chart-topping albums. In the US, however, only a few bands such as HIM[1], Lacuna Coil[2], Evanescence[3]and Cradle of Filth[4] have found commercial success.');
